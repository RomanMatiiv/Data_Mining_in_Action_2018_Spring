1 | the curiosities that you speak of are el electro luminescent pads they are mostly used as backlights for lcd s and as you pointed out comes in several different colors many of them emit white ish colors true white and blue whiteis blue are the ones that i ve personally encountered the most often they vary in their input requirements however they tend to operate at about 100 vrms and at much higher than 60 hz 400 hz to 1 khz if i recall correctly you can get them to work at 120 vrms 60 hz i e line but they don t glow as brightly and they will degrade much faster oh yes almost forgot el s have this tendency to wear out over time

2 | our 20 month son has started falling sick quite often every since he started going to day care he was at home for the first year and he did not fall sick even once now it seems like he has some sort of cold or flu pretty much once a month most of the time the cold leads to an ear infection as well with the result that he ends up being on antibiotics 3 weeks out of 4 i know kids in day care fall sick more often but we are beginning to wonder how often more often really is whether our son is more susceptible or has lower immunity than average what the longer term effects of constantly being sick and taking antibiotics are and what we can do to build up his resistance he really enjoys his day care and we think it s great too but we are beginning to wonder whether we should think about getting a nanny are there any studies that can help answer some of these questions how often do kids in their first second and third years fall sick how often do they get colds flus ear infections is there any data on home care vs day care does being sick build immunity leading to less illness later does it make kids weaker leading to more illness later or does it not have any long term effect does taking antibiotics on a regular basis have any negative long term effects how does one tell if a child is more susceptible to illness than normal and what does one do about it is there any way to build immunity and resistance any data information or advice relating to this would be much appreciated thanks a lot
1 | greetings i ve recently decided to chuck the linear regulators and learn the black magic art of switching power supplies before anyone flames me i know both have their place anyways i ve built the basic up down converters with pretty good results 80 efficiency but i m running into problems when i try to design build anything that puts out serious amps i know it can be done i have some 5v 200a guts on my bench but something puzzles me i m using a simple choke as the storage element basicly a toroid with a single winding but all commercial models use transformers with many windings i traced a few and they seem to use some of the winding for the usual error feedback but some of the others seem to loose me what are they for better than that anyone have a full schematic for one of these that i could get a copy of i d love to see how they manage to squeeze out so much from such low volume my other problems in getting high amps good efficiency are 1 lack of sources of ideal components calculated and 2 limited knowledge of the whole topic i m doing this on my own not school mind you in fact i have yet to take any course that covers transistors so is the answer to 1 the accumulation of dead commercial models and truning into a scavanger not that it s not what i m doing now and 2 getting understanding schematics and a bit more of the mind boggling theory take care p s my goal is 12v 25a in car battery 250vac out and on the other end 250v 5vdc 5a 5v 1a 12vdc 8a and 12vdc 1a the distance between the two will be more than 100 feet of 14 16 gauge but less than 300 feet would like to have a working model in a year or so do i have a chance to make it

1 | most commercial switchers do not use magnetics for their energy storage that s handled by the big caps on the primary side those which in a linearly regulated power supply would be considered the filter caps coming right after the bridge the transformer is just that a transformer it s there primarily to step the voltage up or down although the inductance seen by the switch transistor on the primary side is not negligible as anyone who s zapped said transistor from either failing to get one with a high enough breakdown voltage or neglecting to include a snubber diode across it would tell you actually many transistors intended for switcher use today have the diode built in the basic switched mode power supply operates something like this in a somewhat simplified manner the ac line is rectified to produce a high voltage more or less unregulated dc rail the energy storage or filter caps appear across this rail as does the switching transistor the transistor chops the current into the primary side of the transformer resulting in stepped up or stepped down pulses out the secondary which are then rectified and filtered at least one of the transformer s outputs is sampled and fed back to the control circuit for the switching transistor which acts in a pulse width modulation pwm fashion to control by varying the pulse width the amount of energy being dumped into the primary and therefore the voltage coming out at the secondary the remaining outputs may be allowed to simply run at whatever value they will more or less tracking the regulated output or they may have some additional linear regulation added you may also note that the feedback between the regulated output and the pwm control which is most typically an ic is not done via a direct electrical connection this is due to various safety standards which require primary and secondary circuits to be electrically isolated often the feedback path involves an optoisolator to meet this requirement while the transformer isn t the primary energy storage device in these designs this does not mean that the energy stored in the transformer can be ignored besides the inductive kick giving the switch transistor a bad time as noted above you also need to worry about getting all the energy that went in to the transformer back out again one way or another in some designs this happens more or less automatically but in others you need to take special care to ensure that the transformer core doesn t saturate which again would have disastrous results best left to the imagination i m not by any stretch of the imagination a power supply designer hopefully a real one will come along soon and clean up any gross errors in the above

1 | being in the visualization stage of a circuit design right now i was wondering what the best way to scale an ac voltage using an 8 bit digital word is i am thinking of using the common method of sending the word through an adc and then comparing it with the ac voltage converted to a sawtooth wave to get a duty cycle however i am leary of this method because it a requires a lot of parts and more importantly b creates a lot of interference from the switching on the entire ac line i realize that correct filtering could cancel out most of this interference but that would require more parts and boost the price further someone mentioned to me that they had seen an ic which input 8 bits of data and directly scaled the ac voltage coming in all on chip unfortunately he couldn t remember the chip number or the manufacturer if anyone else has heard of this chip please e mail me i am building this project as a dimmer box for a light controller circuit and it is important that the cost of each box remains very low because one dimmer is required for each light that the user wishes to control well each channel at least therefor if each box costs 150 i doubt that an end user will want to dish out 150 x 16 2400 for sixteen channels this is something i have noticed about today s dimmer boxes they are so expensive anyway any help which someone could offer on either a method of easily doing this or info about the chip which will do it for me always the preferred method will be greatly appreciated

3 | getting wierd again okay we have figure out that a mission specifically to pluto is to large and to expensive okay what about launching one probe with multiple parts kind of liek the old mirv principle of old cold war days basically what i mean is design a mother ship that has piggy backed probes for different missions namely different planets each probe would be tied in with the mother ship or earth as the case may be this is good when and if we go for mars the mars mission can act as either mother ship or relay point for the probes also the mother ship would be powered if not the mars mission by a normal propulsion but also a solar sail main reason for solar sail race is to see what can be done and autmoated the sail would get the probes to were they needed i know the asteroid meteor clouds and such might get in the way of a sail main reasonf ro mother ship idea is to make it more economoical to send multiple probes mission satellites exploreres to different places and cut costs the probes could do fly bys or we shall see

3 | uh why do they have to ask a state commision unless the state s buying such a process will only increace the overhead to the power company of selling different types of light and will decreace the likleihood that they will do so and any efficient lights they might have been planning in the future go down the drain you could order it special if enough people did so it would be low cost last i checked you could use ups to buy stuff in arizona before going there finally i m sure your state has things like small factories and machine shops you could go into business making lights that are cheaper to use thanks to their higher efficiency and the fact that they aren t wasting energy on broadcasting to space and therefore _better_ than the old style five year plans have to be enacted or the planning for the economy will fall apart as if the clean air act really cleaned up the air _my_ experience seems to suggest that you re trying too hard to educate them with the same methods used in american schools to make any subject whatsoever as relevant and boring as proto ugric instead of selling them on the idea well wake up space is becoming a field of human endeavor instead of just something we can look at from a long long way away there are practical space projects that could conceivably although probably not cause lots of light pollution and have been argued against on those grounds even though they might open up such possibilities that people could vacation on mars if they wanted really dark skies
2 | depression can also have various chemical environmental components i noticed that i became depressed in various buildings and at home when the air conditioning was on subsequent testing revealed that i was allergic to stemphyllium a mold commonly found in air conditioners after i began taking antigens that problem disappeared
3 | i had to turn to one of my problem sets that i did in class for this little problem i don t have a calculator but i do have the problem set that we did not too long ago so i ll use that and hope it s what you wanted this is a highly simplified problem with a very simple burst bursts are usually more complex than this example i will use here our burst has a peak flux of 5 43e 6 ergs cm 2 sec 1 and a duration of 8 95 seconds during the frst second of the burst and the last 4 seconds its flux is half of the peak flux it s flux is the peak flux the rest of the time assume that the background flux is 10e 7 erg cm 2 sec 1 then we had to find the integrated luminosity of the burst for several different spheres r 25pc oort cloud radius r 22 5pc at the edge of the galaxy r 183 5pc or the edge of the galactic corona and lastly at a r 8800mpc we integrated the flux over all time to find the fluence then used the old standby formula luminosity 4 pi r 2 fpeak for a radius of 25 pc we found an l around 10 32 erg sec pretty energetic for close by for the coronal model we found around 10 43 erg sec and lastly for the cosmological model an l 10 53 that s what you d call moderately energetic i d say any suggestions about what could put out that much energy in one second jeremy

3 | this question comes up frequently enough that there should be a faq about it
3 | that s fine idea but it only works if the lighting power company even bothers to supply good light fixtures for instance a power company in virginia recently asked a state commission for permission to sell more lights of various type yet all of the different fixture that they sold and wanted to sell were bad designs one that wasted the light thus you couldn t even buy a good light from them in most places to get a good light you have to either order it special at high cost or call a store in arizona at some point society starts to make rules cars have to pass safety tests companies have to meet pollution standards etc there are two ways to achieve this educate the public so that they demand good lighting or force code down the lighting companies backs history seems to suggest that the latter is more likely to work agreed so i won t respond again it s important for all you spacers out there to realize that some people will object to various wild ideas that have been presented just like congress it would be best to consult the astronomers lovers of the night sky before you try some pr stunt to boost public knowledge about space

2 | this is true but it s not quite the whole story there were actually some people who were more careful in their methodology who also replicated the phantom leaf effect one of the most influential critics of kirlian electrophotography is a theosophist and threfore presumably willing to entertain the hypothesis of scientific evidence for a human aura electromagnetic or otherwise professor of electrical engineering at london s city university and a past president of the society for psychic research named a j ellison after years of studying the method and the claims ellison came to the conclusion that the photographic images are what we calls lichtenberg figures an effect of intermittent ionization of the air around the object it s a bit more complicated than not wiping off the plates but it comes down to the same thing in the end kirlian electrophotography has much more limited value if any than was previously widely thought electrical and magnetic fields generated by the body are much too small to be of much use diagnostically without very elaborate equipment and usually also tracer chemicals kind regards

1 | the concrete floor accelerates the problem because it is a heat sink and a colder lead acid battery self discharges at a slightly faster rate that s why the old wives tale of sitting it on a piece of wood on the floor works to help keep from killing the battery as fast it insulates the battery thermally it you ll set the battery down on a piece of styrofoam it will self discharge even slower the best thing would be to attach a small load such as a small transistor radio with the volume turned down low and leave it on constantly but also trickle charge it every couple days too to shallow cycle the charge in the battery such mild exercising of a lead acid battery is the next best thing to completely removing the electrolyte for storage if you do remove the electrolyte may sure you keep separate storage containers for each cell s electrolyte and put it back into the same cells when you refill the battery this isn t so critical for a brand new battery in a fully charged state but will maximize the restored output of an older battery which may not be fully charged when you remove the electrolyte for storage

3 | my apologies if this is a re post i submitted it on friday but got a message that my post might not have gone out considering the confusing spitting contest over rights there are too inalienable rights damn it the majority can be just as destructive of liberty as a despot i suspect that my post did not get out of my site i ain t saying that dark skies are included in these rights although we can only preserve any rights by exercising them anyway here are my thoughts on this i d like to add that some of the protests do not come from a strictly practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for research activities by professional astronomers some of what i would complain about is rooted in aesthetics many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine sacred unsullied by the actions of humans the space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be with full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man any lights were supplied solely by nature uncorruptable by men whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife the space age changed all that the effect of the first sputniks and echo etc on this view could only happen once to see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe but there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky yes i know aircraft are almost always in sight i have to live in a very populated area 6 miles from an international airport currently where light pollution on the ground is ghastly the impact of humans is so extreme here virtually no place exists that has not been shaped sculpted modified trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man in some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans cockroaches and squirrels or rats i visited some friends up in the appalacian mountains one weekend getting away from it all paved roads indoor plumbing malls and it felt good for a while then i quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into dulles 60 80 miles to the east their security light didn t help matters much either but i ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic so i know the skies are rarely perfect but there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn t fouled in some way i mean they ve been trying this forever like concerning tesla s idea to banish night wow i don t watch commercial television but i can imagine just how disgusting beer truck or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high if ya gotta make a buck on it displaying products in heaven at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life to be open about this though i have here my listing of the passage of hst in the evening sky for this weekend tonight friday at 8 25 p m edt it will reach an altitude of 20 1 degrees on the local meridian from baltimore vicinity i ll be trying to see it if i can it _is_ my mealticket after all so i suppose i could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others be that as it may i think my point about a desire for beauty is valid even if it can t ever be perfectly achieved regards wm hathaway baltimore md

2 | i posted about a pulse of relaxation electricity i now think it more like a pulse of relaxation or comfort than a pulse of electricity it is what you feel if you are overwhelmed by a feeling of comfort such as seeing or thinking about something beautiful another thing when you sleep you lie down facing up with your palms aside of you and facing down on the surface of the bed then you relax and there start involuntary nerve firings inside your flesh so you feel a shiver below the surface of the skin not heart beat then this shiver increases and comes up to your head and the roam you hear loudens note that you always hear a high pitch when you lie down in bed this is just the noise of your blood running in your ear this roam is different from the high pitch but follows the shiver of your body shiver is not the word it may be called a mild vibration or quake what is this shiver and roam can i use this to induce out of body experience

1 | if you can modify the design of the dtmf decoder the ideal comunications would be over a multi drop system like rs 485 rs 485 boards are available for pc s probably cheaper than a bunch of rs 232 channels and rs 485 is cheaper to build onto your satellite modules using only a single supply 8 pin dip driver chip software at the pc end would be similarly complex for either rs 232 or rs 485 in my opinion the higher data rates possible with rs 485 would permit quasi simultaneous data transmission hope this helps
3 | idea for repair of satellites warning i am getting creative again why not build a inflatable space dock basically deploy one side of the space dock using a scissor shaped structure saw it on beyond 2000 then maneuer the side to next to the satellite and then move the rest of the dock around the satellite and seal it the inflate the dock with a gas is does not have to be oxygen just neeeds to be non flameble non damaging to the satellite and abel to maintain heat thenheat the space dock for the astronaut who will be working onthe satellite to be able to not have to wear the normal bulky space suit but a much striped down own i know this might take a slot of work or not or just to plain wierd but ideas need to be thought of for where is tomorrow but in the imagination of the present

2 | this is to followup my previous reply on this topic which it has been pointed out to me might have been dangerously misleading in two spots 1 i stated that psychotherapy meaning talking therapy and so on was used to treat obsessive compulsive disorder which though sometimes true is misleading it is not often found effective particularly by itself primary treatment today usually consists at least in part of drug therapy the most current theories of this condition attribute it to more to biological causes than psychological in places where this distinction becomes important 2 i mentioned that the dsm iiir mentions impulses as a possible diagnostic marker however this might look like something people associate with psychotic conditions uncontrollable or unpredictable behaviors which is not the case with ocd one of the diagnostic criteria of ocd is that the individual can and does suppress some of their impulses although they are an unending source of anxiety the obsessive thoughts and ritualistic actions usually associated with ocd are most frequently very mundane and predictable closer to a superstitious nature than a dangerous nature for the most part some references one non technical and several technical that someone was kind enough to supply for me but was unable to post themself technical refs and thanks very much to those who supplied constructive criticism to my first post on ocd i hope this helps clarify the parts that were misleading kind regards
2 | any rocky mountain spotted fever experts out there the doctor thinks a friend might have this the question is doesn t the tick have to bite you you frequently find a tick crawling on you after a walk in the woods around here but you tend to notice it before it bites you pulling one out of your skin is something you re not likely to forget can you get the fever without it biting you do they sometimes bite you and then let go so you don t realize you were bitten i know they will let go once they ve had their fill but you certainly would notice this arggh so how do you get the fever if you never pulled a tick off yourself as opposed to finding one merely crawling on you
2 | i ve sent gordon r my posts on protein vitamin c and vitamin a prior to posting on internet as a professional courtesy somehow i ve managed to delete my vitamin a post from my text file gordon r had promised to send it back to me but he s pretty mad at me right now so i ll just retype it since digging through all my references is very time consuming took me all day for that pms post i m not going to cite any references gordon r has them i m going to include some of the material from weinsier and morgan s new nutrition textbook which was not in my original material to point out that what i m going to say has some support in the medical community diet has been know to affect the immune system of man for a very very long time protein has always had the biggest role in infection and i ve already covered the role of protein in protecting you against infection now i m going to hit what i consider to be the most important nutrient in the u s as far as infection is concerned vitamin a when vitamin a was originally discovered it was commonly referred to as the anti infection vitamin many people linus pauling being one have decided to take this title away from vitamin a and give it to vitamin c which i ve already covered big mistake in my opinion vitamin a is also getting a reputation as an anti cancer vitamin with good reason the nci currently has numerous clinical trials in progress to see if vitamin a can not only prevent cancer but cure it as well it s role in both cancer and infection is almost identical but not quite vitamin a comes in two completely different forms retinol and beta carotene retinol is the animal form and it s toxic beta carotene is the plant form and it s completely nontoxic both retinol and beta carotene display good absorption in the human gut if bile is present 60 80 the liver stores all of your retinol and doles it out for other tissues to use by synthesizing retinol binding protein rbp a normal human adult liver should have 500 000iu to 1 000 000iu of retinol stored we are born with 10 000iu in our liver u s autopsy has shown that about 30 of americans die with the same or less amount of vitamin a as they were born with if you don t believe that nutritional reserves like that of retinol in the liver are important then this low vitamin a reserve is not going to affect you but if you believe like i do that the nutrient reserves are important then there is a problem with vitamin a in the u s the u s rda for vitamin a in an adult male is 1 000 re or 5 000iu of vitamin a for adult feamles its 800 re or 4 000iu of vitamin a diet surveys show that most americans are getting this amount of vitamin a either retinol or beta carotene from their diet but the nrc national research council was going to release a new rda table in 1985 that had the rda for both vitamin a and vitamin c raised c to 90mg per day and a to 7 500iu per day for adult males that report and it s recommendations was killed why concern over the increasing supplementation was the main reason rdas are set to prevent clinical disease not to keep nutrient reserves full many scientist in the u s feel that the time has come to move away from the prevention of clinical pathology concept and move towards the promotion of optimum health concept especially since we have some very good data now that show that nutrient reserves are extremely important during periods of stress the nutritonal concervatives won that battle and a new group of scientist were collected to come out with the 1989 rda list which lowered the rda for several nutrients and moved the dietary guidelines back to where they were when we first started in the 1940 s get enough to prevent clinical pathology but not enough to fill the reserves we know from autopsy that only about 10 of americans have a liver with a normal vitamin a reserve 500 000iu to 1 000 000iu i preach nutrient reserves to my students and tell them to measure them in their patients but for vitamin a only a liver biopsy or autopsy data will tell you how much somebody has stored we can tell very easily if someone has overfilled his or her liver with vitamin a by measuring the serium retinol level levels above 450ug dl are highly suggestive that you have filled your liver with vitamin a and it s time to stop taking retinol the normal range of serum retinol will be 20 100ug dl hypervitaminosis a is diagnosed with a serum retinol level of 2 000ug dl or higher interpretation of diagnostic test wallach m d a little brown series book this level of vitamin a in blood means that medical attention is necessary due to vitamin a toxicity weinsier and morgan take a much more conservative approach to vitamin a toxicity than does wallach as you will see later in this post between 450ug dl and 2 000ug dl you should have plenty of warning that it s time to eliminate the retinol from your diet headache redness of the skin hair loss joint pain i tell all my students that will use vitamin a in their practice that they had better monitor the serum retinol level and stop when there are clear signs that the liver is full you will never really know if the patient needs the vitamin a because you can not measure the pool in liver but you will always know when it s time to stop just like in those vitamin a for pms studies beta carotene can be taken to fill up your liver with retinol and you will never have to worry about toxicity because the conversion of beta carotene to retinol that occurs in both your gut and your liver will slow down stops in the liver and slows down in the gut when your liver is full of retinol but taking beta carotene as the source of retinol takes a very long time to fill the liver up i ve seen estimates of 20 30 years if you are in the 30 that only has as much as you were born with in your liver 10 000iu one other problem with beta carotene if you have a zinc deficit you will not convert as much beta carotene to retinol in the gut or the liver because the enxzyme that does this conversion requires zinc in addition the release of retinol from the liver is a zinc dependent process so a zinc deficit will cause a vitamin a deficit even if your liver has plenty of vitamin a now what does vitamin a do in cancer and infection protection the body uses vitamin a retinol for many different things vision the first to be nailed down and where you see overt clinical pathology uses the aldehyde retinal and alcohol retinol form of vitamin a reproduction uses the retinol form and some retinal infection and cancer protection uses retinoic acid how do you convert retinol which your white blood cells and the mucosal cells get from blood to retinoic acid you use enzymes one of which requires vitamin c this is why pauling has tried to pull the title of anti infection vitamin away from vitamin a vitamin c does play a role in infection interferon production for example but it s biggest role is the conversion of retinol to retinoic acid if you increase your intake of vitamin c you will increase your formation of retinoic acid but retinoic acid can not be converted back to retinol as retinal can and once it s formed it s used and then lost to the body this is why the 1985 nrc group wanted to increase both vitamin c and vitamin a rda s most people taking large amounts of vitamin c really think that they are helping themselves if they don t have much vitamin a in their liver and they are not also increasing their intake of vitamin a they actually do themselves more harm than good retinoic acid functions in white blood cells to promote antibody formation in the mucus membrane it is the main factor in promoting good mucus production and a good epithelial cell barrier to prevent infectious agents from entering the blood system the mucus membrane is referred to as the first line defense against infection for cancer retinoic acid has been shown to act as a cell brake it counteracts the effect of cell promoters which stimulate cells to divide cancer has two distinct steps dna alteration and cell promotion for cells that normally divide all the time promoters are not that important but for lung and breast tissue which does not normally divide promoters are real important in the malignant process this is the major reason why the nci has so many different clinical trials in progress using retinol and or beta carotene chronic infection irritation of the mucus membranes is a signal that vitamin a may not be adequate i tell my students that any patient who walks into their office with a complaint of chronic infection has to be worked up for vitamin a along with the other factors that medicine already has on it s list of causes for chronic infection i drive this home in my course at the osteopathic college in tulsa when i teach at the allopathic medical school in tulsa ou s branch campus and when i give cme lectures dark adaptation is the best clinical test for vitamin a status since night vision is impacted when liver reverves drop to 50 000iu of retinol the serum level of retinol can also be used but it does not drop until liver reserves drop below 10 000 to 20 000iu asking a patient if they have trouble seeing at night is a good initial screen if cataracts are ruled out in one study done on u s spanish americans where serum retinol levels were measured 25 of the sample population had a serum retinol level below 20ug dl as more studies are done on serum retinol levels in population groups of the u s that have had a history of high infection rates we will probably see a much stonger correlation between infection incidence rates and low serum retinol levels what do weinsier and morgan have to say about vitamin a here are excerpts from their book vitamin a functions in vision in the forrm of retinol it is necessay for growth and differentation of epithelial tissue and is required for reproduction embryonic development and bone growth protein calorie malnutrition and zinc deficiency may impair the absorption transport and metabolism of vitamin a retinaldehyde is converted to retinoic acid which has biological activity in growth and in cell diferentiation but not in reproduction or vision the most common procedure to evaluate vitamin a status is to measure the retinol level in plasma or serum the normal range for vitamin a content for a child is 20 to 90ug dl lower values are indicators of deficiency or depleted body stores serum levels greater than 100ug dl are indicative of toxic levels of vitamin a dark adaptation tests and electroretinogram measurements are also useful but difficult to perform on young children rapidly proliferating tissues are sensitive to vitamin a deficiency and may revert to an undifferentiated state the bronchorespiratory tract skin genitourinary system gastrointestinal tract and sweat glands are adversely affected a daily intake of more than 7 5mg about 37 000iu of retinol is not advised and chronic use of amounts over 20mg 100 000iu can result in a dry and itching skin desquamation erythematous dermatitis hair loss joint pain chapped lips hyperostois bony depositis headaches anorexia edema and fatigue they recommend 30mg of retinol via im injection in children for vitamin a deficiency but do not discuss treatment for adults their toxic serum retinol level is very conservative i recommend that my students try 25 000iu in adults that are having problems with chronic infection they have to rule out a zinc deficit first by getting an rbc zinc run or if their clinical lab can t run it i tell them to do what weinsier and morgan suggest give them the zinc along with the vitamin a at 25 000iu per day toxicity should not be a problem and you will not have to worry about pulling the patient into the office on a regular basis to run a serum retinol both elaine and jon found doctors who used a much higher dose of vitamin a recall that the pms papers were using 100 000iu to 200 000iu of vitamin a i don t suggest that my students use these high doses if you wanted to fill the liver up fast as part of a clinical trial and were monitoring the serum retinol level then you would be okay but my knowledge of the vitamin a literature suggests to me that 25 000iu for patients with a demonstrated vitamin a deficit dark adapatation test or serum retinol will provide a good and steady improvement as long as zinc and vitamin c status are good without having to worry about toxicity if they want to get more agressive fine if they follow my advise to check the serum retinol but vitamin a retinol should never be given in high dose to women who could become pregnant since vitamin a shows teratogenicity towards the human fetus the dose needed to show this effect on the developing fetus is 18 000iu of retinol per day beta carotene will never have this effect on the human fetus could just taking beta carotene instead of retinol supplements help yes but the effect will take a long time to develop my advise is to use retinol to fill the liver up and then switch to beta carotene to keep it full vitamin a is probably one nutrient that is better off left to prescription by doctors but when we have the m d s in this newsgroup jumping all over me and other doctors that propose the use of vitamin a supplements for treating patients with chronic sinus and gi distress i think that the most prudent option is to keep vitamin a in the otc market but require manufactors to provide package inserts to educate the general public about the dangers of vitamin a supplementation
3 | well there are several bursts in species diversity i can think of the cambrian and ordovician explosions resulted in a vast increase in animal diversity likewise after the one two punch of the permian and triassic extinctions the number of marine animals rose steadily to an all time high just prior to the spread of humans biggest exception being the k t bye bye dinos extinction about 800 families also plants arose from green algae and colonized the land in succesive sweeps mosses colonized very wet environments first ferns who had evolved vascular tissues took over more territory when they evolved 1 these were eventually mostly replaced by gymnosperms pines and the like 2 and then mostly displaced by angiosperms flowering plants now the dominant plant group on the planet 3 fungi also radiated greatly with the invasion of the land 1 around the carboniferous up to about 200 families 2 around the triassic up to maybe 250 families 3 starting in the cretaceous rising to about 600 families currently it s unclear to me at least what the max equilibrium number of species the earth can hold and if it has ever hit this in the past it could be warning speculation alert that diversity has never reached a peak because mass extinctions happen often enough to keep the total number down this would depend a great deal on how fragmented specific ecosystems were see cowen s book history of life for a not too technical run down on well like the title sez the history of life or see wilson s diversity of life for a view centered more on current ecology this is imho the best popular biology book of what the hell i ll say it all time follow ups to t o

3 | well almost it turns out that clever orbital mechanics can engineer things so that resonant interactions with the higher order harmonics of the earth s gravitational field can pump energy into a satellite and keep it from experiencing drag effects for periods of months to years my favorite example of this is the soviet russian heavy elint satellites of the cosmos 1603 class which are in 14 1 resonance in particular c1833 has undergone two periods of prolonged gain in altitude the current one having started in june 1991 the mean altitude of the satellite is now as high as it has ever been since launch on 18 march 1987 looking at the elements for c1833 also shows the limitations of norad s software but that s another story this probably has little relevance to space stations since the 71 degree orbits of the c1603 satellites are at 850 km which is unacceptably far into the inner van allen belt for manned platforms but it s kind of interesting from the point of view of the physics of the situation orbital elements for these satellites are available on request allen thomson saic mclean va

2 | srebrenica s doctor recounts town s living hell by laura pitter tuzla bosnia reuter neret mujanovic was a pathologist when he trekked through the mountains to the besieged muslim town of srebrenica last august but after treating 4 000 mangled victims of bosnia s bloody war he considers himself a surgeon now i m a surgeon with great experience although i have no license to practice but if i operate on a person and he lives normally that s the greatest license a surgeon could have evacuated by the u n this week to his home town of tuzla the muslim physician gave an eyewitness medical assessment of the horrors of the year long serb siege of srebrenica and the suffering of the thousands trapped there i lived through hell together with the people of srebrenica all those who lived through this are the greatest heroes that humanity can produce he told reporters mujanovic 31 had practiced for two months as an assistant at a local hospital in tuzla but before going to srebrenica he had never performed a surgical operation on his own now he says he has performed major surgery 1 396 times relying on books for guidance amputating arms and legs 150 times usually without anesthetic delivering 350 babies and performing four cesarean sections he worked 18 to 19 hour days slept in the hospital for the first 10 weeks after his arrival last aug 5 and treated 4 000 patients he arrived after making the trek over mountains on foot from tuzla 60 miles northwest of srebrenica about 50 other people carried in supplies and 350 soldiers guided and protected him through guerrilla terrain he said his worst memory was of 10 days ago when seven serb shells landed within one minute in an area half the size of a football field killing 36 people immediately and wounding 102 half of the dead were women and children the people had come out for a rare day of sunshine and the children were playing soccer there was no warning the blood flowed like a river in the street he said there were pieces of women all around and you could not piece them together one woman holding her two children in her hands was lying with them on the ground dead they had no heads before mujanovic arrived with his supplies conditions were deplorable he said many deaths could have been prevented had the hospital had surgical tools facilities and medicine the six general practitioners who had been operating before he arrived had even less surgical experience than he did they didn t know the basic principles for amputating limbs once he arrived the situation improved he said but by mid september he had run out of supplies bandages were washed and boiled five times sometimes they were falling apart in my hands he said doctors had no anesthetic and could not give patients alcohol to numb the pain because it increased bleeding people were completely conscious during amputations and stomach operations he said blood transfusions were impossible because they had no facilities to test blood types i felt destroyed psychologically mujanovic said the situation improved after dec 4 when a convoy arrived from the belgian medical group medecins sans frontieres but mujanovic said the military predicament worsened in mid december after bosnian serbs began a major offensive in the region every day we had air strikes and shellings then the hunger set in between mid december and mid march when u s planes began air dropping food between 20 and 30 people were dying every day from complications associated with malnutrition he said i know for sure that the air drop operation saved the people from massive death by hunger and starvation he said according to mujanovic around 5 000 people died in srebrenica 1 000 of them children during a year of siege mujanovic plans to return to srebrenica in three weeks after visiting his wife who is ill in tuzla they say i m a hero he said there were thousands of people standing at the sides of the road crying and waving when i left and i cried too

1 | they do interpolate it s not linear interpolation though you are correct that the frequency content is not altered more specifically the baseband spectrum is preserved and so is every nth image spectrum the other n 1 in n image spectra are removed where n is the oversampling rate ideally the filter has a gain of 1 from 0hz to 22050hz and a gain of 0 from 22050 to the new nyquist frequency in practice a finite transition band is required and there is also a certain amount of pass band ripple and stop band leakage with a high order eg 200 taps digital filter a very good approximation can be easily achieved bit deleted about observations of interpolation filter at work no they actually use a digital fir just like yours but built in hardware on custom vlsi chips for mainly economic reasons i guess that the answer is somewhere between the two as an interesting aside some of you out there may be aware of a scheme used by pioneer and wadia which is called by pioneer at least legato link i haven t heard one of these players but by reading advertising blurb and a couple of pseudo technical articles i deduced that all they do is build a lousy digital oversampling filter and let a load of the first image ie aliassed spectrum through talking to bob stuart of boothroyd stuart aka meridian confirmed my suspicion he said that it sounded awful but then he would wouldn t he christopher

3 | i like this statement though for my own reasons cost comparisons depend a lot on whether the two options are similar and then it becomes very revealing to consider what their differences are can soyuz launch the long exposure facility course not will the shuttle take my television relay to leo by year s end almost certainly not but the russians are pretty good about making space accessible on a tight schedule comparing s and ss points up that there are two active space launcher and work platform resources with similarities and differences where they are in direct competition we may get to see some market economics come into play tombaker
3 | in space digest v16 487 about the protests over proposals to put a giant billboard into orbit mr hathaway s post is right on the money if a little lengthy in short an orbiting billboard would be trash in the same way that a billboard on the earth is trash billboards make a place look trashy that is why there are laws in many places prohibiting their use the light pollution complaints are mainly an attempt to find some tangible reason to be against orbiting billboards because people don t feel morally justified to complain on the grounds that these things would defile the beauty of the sky regular orbiting spacecraft are not the same in this respect since they are more like abstract entities but a billboard in space would be like a beer can somebody had thrown on the side of the road just trash

2 | does anyone know if either theophylline or ephedrine or the two in combination can reduce the body s ability to make use of available water i had kind of an odd experience on a group hike recently becoming dehyrated after about 9 hours of rigorous hiking despite having brought 1 1 2 gallons of water c 6 liters i drank close to twice as much as anyone else and no one else was dehydrated i don t think general physical condition was an issue since i was in at least the middle of the pack in terms of general stamina so far as i could tell

2 | how is it that placebos are legal it would seem to me that if as a patient you purchase a drug you ve been prescribed and it s just sugar or whatever there s a few legal complications that arise 1 if you have been diagnosed with a condition and you aren t given accepted treatment for it it seems like intentional medical malpractice 2 a placebo should fall legally under the label of quackery why not 3 getting what you pay for deceptive bait and switch to an extreme false advertising what if mcdonalds didn t put 100 pure beef in their hamburgers so i m mystified are these assumptions erred if they aren t why the hell can a doctor knowingly or unknowingly prescribe a placebo

3 | i disagree it think the average joe is interested curious about spaceflight but sees it as an elitist activity not one which he is ever going to participate in why is the general public going to be interested in the technical details of long term space habitation i like the idea of the study but it should be released to other scientists and engineers who will be able to use it if you want a general public document you ll need a more general publication as one working on controlled ecological life support systems engineering the microworld isn t the problem the problem is understanding the basic chemical biological and medical factors to be able to engineer them efficiently for example the only way we know how to produce food is from plants and animals food synthesis is not very far advanced so we have to orbit a farm well that s obviously not very efficient so we use technology to reduce the mass and grow plants hydroponically instead of using dirt this is where the engineering comes in but new technologies bring new basic questions that we don t have the answers to like in dirt we can grow tomatoes and lettuce right beside each other but in hydroponics it turns out that you can t do that the lettuce growth is stunted when it s grown in the same hydroponic solution as tomatoes so now you have to consider what other plants are going to have similar interactions this means some basic applied scientific research and that s what needs to be done with all technologies that have been developed so far we also need to find out how they interact together that s where we are now first you need to do the literature search there is a lot of information out there maybe we should just pick a specific area of long term habitation this could be useful especially if we make it available on the net then we can look at methods of analyzing the technologies unless there is an unbelievable outpouring of interest on this on the net i think we should develop a detailed data base of the literature search first then if we accomplish that we can go on to real analysis the data base itself could be useful for future engineers that s my response ken what do you think

2 | perhaps the listlessness caused by thyroid deficiency could mimic depression or feeling unable to do anything could cause one to get depressed but i know of no specific effect on the brain caused by the thyroid that would cause depression note that weight gain is usually a symptom of both simple blood tests would indicate if a thyroid condition is present i don t know if depression would cause a reduction in thyroid output but i would tend to doubt it as far as i know clinical depression is caused by a chemical imbalance in the brain and that chemical imbalance has no direct effect on any other part of the body a regular everyday depression imho should not cause a chemical imbalance in the body at all the pituitary bases its secretions of thyroid stimulating hormone tsh on the level of circulating thyroxin there are two types t3 and t4 one is used as a reserve and is changed into the other active form in the liver the ratio of t3 t4 can be affected by a number of other hormones estrogen for example naturally changing activity of the body s cells would cause changes in availabilty of free thyroxin but the liver and a healthy thyroid should be able to balance things out in short order good sources for info on the thyroid are the merk manual a physician s reference book although reading it is enough to get one depressed and the encyclopedia brittanica should be available in your local library i hope this has been of some help

3 | it is interesting to note in the past few days correspondance that some believe that poor old new mexico is not capable of hosting a commercial space launch business for many reasons it can and we here on the front lines see no reason why it should not the spaceport political publicity referred to the other day had its intended effect the state of new mexico did establish the start of the necessary government infrastructure to back a commercial space port the commanding general at wsmr is in full support of dual use for the facilities the wsmr location also has some strategic advantages in the form of necessary infrastructure and controlled air space to support the project just because the folks involved have not done the traditional aerospace equivalent of vapor ware by inviting folks out to kick non existent tires but have been merely doing their job to prepare for launch don t think that nothing has happened from my interactions with the macdac folks i get the impression that they want to set a firm believable launch date based on vehicle readiness and not just some fiction to plug a space on a calendar i believe that all will happen this summer and don t worry the locals here are planning to let everyone know when it does occur stephen horan shoran nmsu edu
1 | hams can legally run up to 1500 watts it is very unlikely however that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car ham rigs not possible either you d need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier i can just see it you need to slow down on a downgrade so you hit the push to talk button well 100 amps anyway transmissions are generally for a short interval the battery would supply the rest of course if you transmitted too much you would run the battery down it really would not be that much of a brake even at 50 efficiency 1500 watts would only consume 4 horsepower

1 | yup it s not all that difficult to do the panasonic cartridges aren t bad but they aren t spectacular don t mount it on the side call up crown the company that has the patent on the pzm and ask them for information on construction and use of the things you may have to determine the correct spacing emperically with a noise source and a spectrum analyzer because the design of the panasonic cartridges uses a tuned cavity in front of the electret element to increase the high frequency response and you are going to be altering the resistance through the cavity entrance crown has a nice book on the subject though it s unfortunately rather short on mathematics there s a jaes article from many years back too

3 | this is shall we say an overly broad statement in particular are you referring to the native american culture that existed in 1400 or the one that existed in 1800 simplify things by assuming we re talking about the eastern us rather than the whole continent given that those were radically different cultures which one are you referring to note that the pre columbian native americans east of the mississippi did all of these things well maybe not on sunday but they did have organized religions not to mention cities and governments if you are judging the native americans by the tribal culture that existed in 1800 you might want to read an account of the de soto expedition to find out what pre columbian native american culture at least in the more civilized parts of the continent was like

2 | nnget 93122 1300541 and where do you advise people to turn for cancer information most it seems to me you ve offered a circular refutation of moss s organization who has shown the information in the latest book of pac to be questionable could it be those regulatory agencies and medical industries which moss is showing to be operating with major vested interests whether one believes that these vested interests are real or not or whether or not they actually shape medical research is a seperate argument if one sees a possibility however that these interests exist then the fact that some of the information put out by pac has been refuted by the medical industry doesn t hold much weight as for the ineffectiveness of antineoplasteons the fact that the nih didn t find them effective doesn t make much sense here of course they didn t i tend to have more faith in the word of the patients who are now alive after being told years ago that they would be dead of cancer soon they are fighting like hell to keep that clinic open and they credit his treatment with their survival anyone who looks at the nih s record for investigation of alterna tive cancer therapies will easily see that they have a strange knack for find ing relatively cheap and nontoxic therapies dangerous or useless

3 | also as implied by other posters why do you need to boost the orbit on this mission anyway you don t need to but it s desirable hst like all satellites in low earth orbit is gradually losing altitude due to air drag it was deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach for that reason it needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter it has no propulsion system of its own has any thought been given as to how they are going to boost the hst yet give it a push i can see the push start cartoons now

1 | what kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects the affected equipment is about 100 feet from the road might be a couple of hundred watts from the sound of it kicking sound out of the tv and stereo speakers by direct rf rectification requires a mighty strong carrier i ve heard of linears so powerful that triggering them while the car was idling would stall the engine by pulling down the battery voltage it would take a lot more than that it sounds like the radio equipment is actually not shut completely off but just goes to a standby situation i suspect that the stories are just that stories the voltage can only be sucked down so far instantaneously when you try to jumpstart someones car when your vehicle is at idle does your car stall no the other car just does not crank well now the engine might stall because the idle was too low to start with when the extra current is drawn the idle speed will drop as the alternator loads down the engine to compensate for the increased amperage requirement is resolution of this problem a matter for the power company the fcc or both ultimately it s likely to be your problem to resolve i m afraid the fcc is so understaffed that they don t pay much attention to citizen complains about rfi or so i ve heard they ll just send you a pamphlet describing how you can apply corrective measures talking to the power company might help they might be able to install filtering devices at your service panel or recommend a type which you could have installed by a licensed electrician a transmitter is not going to be affecting house power if surges are occurring there it is due to another cause not a transmitter unfortunately there s a fair chance that enough signal is being picked up by your house wiring that a simple service panel filter won t suffice you may need to install heavy duty rfi filters at the power connections of your affected equipment it is probably not that much of a problem often toroid coils on the power leads will solve that part of the interference problem it will not solve internal equipment deficiencies if the problem occurs regularly you may need to stake out the street in question and watch for trucks or cars with big antennae driving by at the time interference occurs if you can identify the vehicle which is transmitting you may be able to contact its owner and complain it is probably not the transmitter that is at fault if the person is an amateur then he she will probably be willing to help if you explain that the person is causing interference
2 | no doubt the sci med folks are getting out their flamethrowers i m rather certain that the information you got was not medical literature in the accepted academic scientific journals so the righteous among them will no doubt jump on that also insofar as it doesn t conform to the accepted medical presumption that it just doesn t matter what you eat and that we can think of the gi tract as a black box in which nothing ever goes wrong except for maybe cancer and ulcers the righteous will no doubt jump on that too then there ll be the ones who call your doctor a raving quack even though he like linus pauling is lucid and robust well into his nineties but nevermind about that he shouldn t charge for his equipment and supplies since they re no doubt not approved by the fda of course with fda approval an md or pharmaceutical company can charge whatever they can get for such safe and effective treatments as thalidomide but nevermind about that either unfortunately you dared to step into the sacred turf of net medical discussion without a credential and without understanding that the righteous among them will make certain that you are suitably denounced before dismissing you as a fool but maybe somebody without such a huge chip on their shoulder will send you some reasonable responses by e mail 1 2 1 2 oh yes i did have a point a few years ago an md with a thriving practice in a very wealthy part of silicon valley once recommended that i take such treatments to clear up a skin condition not through his office i might add although i m sure that s not conclusive it was sure an unusual prescription

1 | i m wondering if it s possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance this would be for short distances 2000 ft and i would need to have accuracy of 6 inches or so you might try looking at whats available in laser locating systems they work best for close work 1 mile and under rf is used for much longer distances in two major modes transponder and phase measurment transponder requires you send a pulse to another station and it returns it to you and you measure the round trip time minus the receiver time phase measurements require two or more transmitting stations sending the same frequency signal multiplexed in time a receiver can pick them up and measure the phase shift between signals maps can be drawn that plot the lines of position that correspond to a certain phase shift between two stations

3 | thanks to the people who have answered here and in email to my question about which countries engage in space surveillance unfortunately i apparently didn t make the meaning of the message clear since most replies have addressed satellite reconnaissance rather than space surveillance what i meant was _not_ which countries use satellites to look at the earth satellite reconnaissance but _was_ which countries have programs to detect and track i e determine the orbital elements of satellites as they pass overhead space surveillance the us uses missile defense radars supplemented by a fascinating quasi radar operated by the navy to do this for satellites in leo and electrooptical systems for objects at altitudes above 5 000 km or so the fee i understand does much the same thing amateur satellite observers use eyeballs binoculars stopwatches and pcs for objects out to around 1500 km enabling them to keep track of satellites for which ah official element sets aren t available see the fascinating books by desmond king hele for details as well as the files in the molczan directory on kilroy jpl nasa gov the material posted in my previous message suggests that japan engages in optical and radar space surveillance to a modest degree and it may be that other countries do also which was the question i meant to ask who are they how do they do it and why do they do it allen thomson saic mclean va

3 | no if you put a conductor in a changing magnetic field it produces a voltage the two ways you can do that with a permanent magnet is to move the magnet or move the conductor the slow shifting of the earth s magnetic field isn t really significant especially when you consider how weak the earth s magnetic field is to begin with well it would require generating an incredibly large magnetic field to repel the earth s magnetic field as a magnet can repel another magnet of course this force only works in one direction and the magnetic field generated has to be unimaginably powerful magnetic repulsion drops off as 1 r 3 and the earth s magnetic field on the surface is already very weak it would require some sort of unknown superconductor and special nonmagnetic construction and seriously hardenned electronics optical computers perhaps and the physiological danger would be significant due to the iron content in our blood among other things in other words forget it i missed out on the dragless satellite thread but it sounds totally bogus from this little bit
2 | i ve got a very nice collection of historical books on medical quackery and on the topic of massage this is a recurring theme ordinary massage is intended to make a person feel better especially if they have muscular or joint problems but like chiropracty there are some practitioners who take the technique to a far extreme invoking what seems to me to be quack science to justify their technique in the case of massage there is a technique called deep abdominal massage in which the masseur is literally attempting to massage the intestines the notion is that undigested food adheres to the inner surface of the intestines and putrifies releasing poisons which cause various disease syndromes by this vigorous and painful procedure it is alleged that these deposits can be loosened up and passed out

2 | for a very long time i ve had a problem with feeling really awful when i try to get up in the morning my sleep latency at night is also pretty long ranging from 30 min to an hour i get about 7 hours of bedtime maybe 6 of actual sleep a night and more on the weekends i will spend two or three hours laying in bed after this if i can because i feel so tired when i wake up even more tired than i was when i went to bed which is usually too tired to work anyway i recently had a really bad flu so i called a friend to get me some cough syrup with both an expectorant and a nasal decongestant but he got vicks formula 44m which has everything but an expectorant so i used that anyway and the three nights i used it i fell asleep rapidly and felt that i got really good quality sleep that is i actually felt refreshed the next morning so i am now trying to look into both in the literature and experimentally the use of antihistamines as sleep aids since i am presuming that it was the antihistamine that caused the effect the antihistamine in vicks formula 44 is chloriphenamine maleate so i bought some generic tablets of that and tried one last night and didn t notice any improvement i might try one with a little alcohol about 1 beer to see if it is a synergism effect also library research seems to show that benadryl is the antihistamine with the strongest sedative effect of what is availible otc so i might also buy a generic form of that and try that the pdr seems to suggest that 50 mg is a good dosage level to try for other medical information i have allergies but rarely have an allergic reaction living in new mexico i also have chronically dry eyes which get horrible if i try to use most underarm deoderants i did guess that my problem might be caused by hypoglycemia so i made some changes in my diet consistent with that and it didn t help so i went back to a normal diet pretty diverse also taking vitamin supplements

2 | this question came up in sci med nutrition and i m posting my answer here only 22 medical schools in the u s teach courses on human nutrition we have already seen what a lack of nutrition education can do when candida and kidney stones present themselves to the medical community i think that the best example of where u s medicine is really missing the mark when it comes to a knowledge of nutrition is pms so many women and their husbands suffer from this disorder that it is really criminal that most physicians in the u s are not taught that pms is primarily caused by diet and diet changes can prevent it from ever happpening before shooting your flames read the entire article and then decide if flaming is justified from a poster in sci medi nutrition side tracked with candida pms is a lot like candida blooms most physicians don t recognize it as a specific disease entity here is everything that you would ever want to know about pms premenstrual syndrome has been divided into four specific subgroups pmt a anxiety pmt d depression anxiety depression irritability forgetfulness insomnia confusion depression lethargy pmt c craving pmt h hyperhydration craving for sweets weight gain increased appetite breast congestion and tenderness sugar ingestion causes abdominal bloating and tenderness 1 headache edema of the face and extremities 2 palpitations 3 fatigue or fainting pmt a is characterized by elevated blood estrogen levels and low progesterone levels during the luteal phase of a women s cycle pmt c is caused by the ingestion of large amounts of refined simple carbohydrates during the luteal phase of a women s cycle there is increased glucose tolerance with a flat glucose curve after oral glucose challenge the metabolic findings believed to be responsible for pmt c are a low magnesium and a low prostaglandin e1 this condition of hypoglycemia is not unique to pms but there are a number of different causes of hypoglycemia magnesium and pge1 seem to be specific to pms hypoglycemia a am j psychiatry 147 4 477 80 1990 unrefined complex carbohydrate should be substituted for sugar magnesium supplementation and alpha linoleic acid supplementation increased to 5 6 of the total calories using safflower oil or evening primrose oil as sources of alpha linoleic acid pmt d is characterized by elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase of a women s cycle another cause of pmt d has been found to be lead toxicity in women without elevated progesterone levels during the midluteal phase effect of metal ions on the binding of estridol to human endometrial cystol fertil steril 28 312 18 1972 pmt h is associated with water and salt retention along with an elevated serum aldosterone level salt restriction b6

hard as finding one that will treat you for candida blooms while progesterone will work supplementation with vitamins and minerals works even better there really has been an awful lot of research done on pms much more than candida blooms many of these studies have been what are called experimental controlled studies the type of rigorous clinical studies that doctors like to see done here are a few of these studies carbohydrate experimental controlled study effect of a low fat high carbohydrate diet on symptoms of cyclical mastopathy lancet 2 128 32 1988 21 pts with severe persistent cyclical mastopathy of at least 5 years duration were randomly selected to receive specific training to reduce dietary fat to 15 of total calories and increase complex carbohydrate ingestion or given general dietary advise with no training after 6 months there was a significant reduction in the severity of the breast swelling and tenderness in the trained group as reported by self reported symptoms as well as physical exams which quantitated the degree of breast swelling tenderness and nodularity vitamin a experimental controlled study the use of vitamin a in premenstrual tension acta obstet

see if this normal vitamin a pool could prevent pms 48 getting the high dose vitamin a had complete remission of the symptoms of pms only 10 getting the placebo reported getting complete relief of pms

30 pts received 200 000iu of vitamin a daily starting on day 15 of their cycle with supplementation continuing until the onset of pms symptoms after 2 6 months all 30 pts reported a significant improvement in pms symptoms vitamin a supplementation was stopped once evidence of toxicity was demonstrated and all 30 pts were followed for one year after high dose vitamin a supplementation was stopped pms symptoms did not reoccur in any of these 30 pts for upto one year after the vitamin a supplementation was stopped most americans do not have a normal store of vitamin a in their liver these studies and several others were designed to see if getting a normal store of vitamin a into the liver could eliminate pms of all the vitamins given for pms vitamin a b6 and vitamin e vitamin a has shown the best single effect this is probably because vitamin a is involved in steroid estrogen progesterone metabolism in the liver getting your liver full of vitamin a seems to be one of the best things that you can do to prevent the symptoms of pms but vitamin a is toxic and you don t want to be trying to do this without being seen by a physician who can monitor you for vitamin a

on birth control pills should be supplemented with 10 15 mg of b6 per day the dose should be increased if symptoms of pms appear dr david r rubinow who heads the biological psychiatry branch of nimh was quoted in clin psychiatry news december 1987 as stating that b6 should be considered the first line drug for pms over progesterone and if the patient does not respond then other treatments should

to the onset of the menstrual flow after 2 cycles both groups received magnesium the menstrual distress questionnaire score of the cluster pain was significantly reduced during the second cycle month for the magnesium treatment group as well as the placebo group once they were switched to magnesium supplementation in addition the total score on the menstrual distress questionnaire was significantly decreased by magnesium supplementation the authors suggest that magnesium supplemenation should become a routine treatment for the mood changes that occur during pms there are numerous observational studies that have been published in the medical literature which also suggest that pms is primarily a disorder that arises out of a hormone imbalance that is dietary in nature but since observational studies are considered by most physicians in sci med to be anecdotal in nature i have not bothered to cite them there are also over a half dozen good experimental studies that have been done on multivitamin and mineral supplementation to prevent pms i ve chosen the best specific studies on individual vitamins and minerals to try to point out that pms is primarily a nutritional disorder but doctors don t recognize nutritional disorders unless they can see clinical pathology beri beri pellagra scruvy etc pms is probably the best reason why every doctor being trained in the u s should get a good course on human nutrition pms is really only the tip if the iceberg when it comes to nutritional disorders it s time that medicine woke up and smelled the roses here s some studies

3 | where did that idea come from it s news to me
1 | i have recently used the 4066 to switch a bipolar signal i simply ran the 4066 off a bipolar supply 8v in this case as long as your analog input signal stays between the supply rails the 4066 will work fine of course your control logic input must use 8v as the logic low and 8v as the logic high reference so that either 1 all your driving logic must be 4000 cmos with the same bipolar supply or 2 you must provide some kind of voltage level shifting circuit between the 4066 and the control logic in my case i was able to use the bipolar supply all the way

1 | yet another suggestion but this one is non toxic although i would handle it like any other cleaner and it smells nice the chemical is called d limonene and it smells like lemon peels i think it is a lemon extract of some kind you might find it in a hardware store sold as a general purpose solvent but your best bet would be any bike store it is used as a chain cleaning fluid it works on sticker glue crayons grease oil etc it s clear yellow in the bottle and you can use it straight if you add water it changes to a creamy consistency which is good for some jobs
2 | these are my last words on the subject some people think it enhances the flavor i personally don t think it helps the taste it makes me sick so i try to avoid it well i know that msg effects me adversely maybe not permanently but at least temporarily enough that i like to try to avoid the stuff excuse me why can t people learn to cook from scratch on the net i ve gotten lots of recipes off the net that don t use additives if you like additives then get off the net and go to your local supermarket buy lots of packaged foods and you get off the net i don t hey i ll pay my hard earned dollars to buy food that costs more but does not have preservatives i choose to speak with my pocketbook in many ways nacho cheese doritos breading for many frozen fried foods like fish and chicken etc ad naseum or the and other natural flavorings syndrome it s been a few years since i ve bought anything labelled with and other natural flavorings well i had had similar reactions many times that was when i really started watching carefully reaction to doritos hey guess what s in there reaction to lawry s season salt guess what s in there i ll give you a hint i ve had enough problems with many many many different products with msg that i figured out one thing unless i plan on getting sick i won t eat the stuff without my seldane and did i ever learn to read labels which was why i started checking every time i got sick and every time i got sick msg was somehow involved in one of the food products and consider there were no other similar ingredients to my knowledge it might not please a medical researcher but it pleased my own personal physician enough for him to give me allergy medicine and most importantly it s enough proof for me to avoid it and enough proof that my incredibly frugal fiance didn t flinch when i literally threw out or gave away all the food products in his pantry that had msg and he always flinches when there s waste but it was a simple explanation i won t eat this stuff i won t cook with this stuff so i can either throw it out or give it away probably lawry s seasoning salt i love the way that tastes i m not saying i never consume anything with msg i ve noticed that i have a certain tolerance level like a small bag of bbq chips once a month or so it not a problem but that same bag of chips will bother me if i also had chicken bouillon yesterday and lunch at one of the chinese restaurants the day before but some say that only 2 of the population has a problem with msg some say it s more like 20 but let s say that it s 5 how many people would have to be tested that would have a problem also i know i have a problem with it and i wouldn t volunteer for a test like thanks guys but i don t want to get sick also i m sure that most people probably have varying degrees of sensitivities at different times if i have a cold i m much more susceptible to the reaction than when i m healthy as proven today when i m stuffy but for some silly reason i still gave in and decided to have the bbq chips cathy doesn t i haven t saved all my postings but i never called it chinese restaurant syndrome and i never stated i got it only from chinese food i just thought it would be easiest to conduct my personal test at a chinese take out place that i knew would hold or not hold the msg i can t call up whoever makes doritos and ask them to make me one back of chips without msg well i believe i mentioned that in an earlier post let s see you wrote this message at date 20 apr 1993 00 09 31 0500 but on date 19 apr 1993 16 33 18 gmt oh and just in case anyone thinks i m prejudice against either chinese food or asian people i m not going home to cook some chinese food for the guy i m marrying next week incidentally his last name is wu so stop it with the flame mail why does a woman work ten years to change a man s habits and then complain that he s not the man she married barbra streisand

3 | i didn t want to quote all the stuff that s been said recently i just wanted to add a point the whole question of a right to a dark sky revolves around the definition of a right moral rights and natural rights are all well and good but as far as i can see a right is whatever you or someone representing you can enforce in most civilizations the government or the church or both defines what the rights of the citizens are and then enforces those rights for them here in the u s the constitution provides a bill of rights from which most if not all legal rights are considered to derive i m sure that most other countries have comparable documents if you can persuade a court that you have a right to a dark sky derived in some manner from the bill of rights in the u s you can prevent maybe these billboards from being launched to keep anyone in the world from launching then gets into international law and the international court of justice correct name in the hague something i know little about
1 | it has been a while since i knew the electronics of ham radio but i seem to remember that pep is actually 4x the real power which makes 1kw pep actually around 250w or was it 2x i disremember effective transmitted power is also odd in that it takes into account antenna height and geometry which is why a tv station with a 50kw klystron might advertise a megawatt if their antenna is on the top of the cn tower this is like sears hp though 1500 real watts still isn t impossible about 125 150a with a 12v alternator less if the alternator produces higher voltages it s only three horsepower taking into account inefficiencies you ll feel it when you hit the key but not too much

1 | from management of electronics assembly ian oakes after talking about 63 37 tin lead alloy and the eutectic point occasionally impurities may be added to solder to vary charactersitics within the soldering process in an attempt to improve performance for example addition of small quantities of antimony and copper can reduce the amount solder moves under stress when solid for particular applications additions of impurities may be warranted but in general it is best to keep the solder used in a soldering process as pure as possible i guess this is the good oil for commercial operations but it doesn t mention anything esoteric

3 | i m worried by the concern about it though for a number of reasons that have nothing to do with space advertising which for a number of reasons is probably doomed to fail on financial grounds and i ve been reading and and writing this thread since way back when it was only on sci space for starters i don t think the piece of light pollution apparatus would be as bright as the full moon _that_ seems to me to be a bit of propaganda on the part of opponents or wishful thinking on the part of proponents second this charge of ruining the night sky permanently has been levelled against other projects that either 1 don t increace light pollution significantly or 2 increace light pollution only over the target area you may or may not recognize 1 as being solar power sattelites i think it was josh hopkins who actually did the math showing that sps s weren t that bright after all ending some two months of frenzied opposition on the part of dark sky activists and various other types 2 is mainly projects like the orbiting mirror the cis tested recently while slightly more worrisome i d like to point out that any significant scattering of light outside the target area for one of these mirrors would be wasted as far as the project would be concerned and something any project like that would work against anyway and given some of the likely targets i don t think there s going to be much of an outcry from the inhabitants there is too much dark sky in the northern cis during the winter and i doubt you ll find many activists in murmansk demanding the natural sky back if anything he ll probably be inside stripped buck naked in front of the uv lamp making sure he ll get enough vitamin d for the day the mirror experiments aren t something they re doing for crass advertising they think that if they can build one it ll be one of those things people in the affected areas will think they couldn t have lived without before and i doubt anyone s going to really be able to convince them to stop
2 | when kids stayed in the home until kindergarden or 1st grade infection incidence was much lower because exposure was lower some studies suggest that early exposure to various infectious diseases is probably beneficial because exposure as an adult carries much more risk of morbitity and mortality mumps measles etc daycare will always carry a higher exposure risk than home care exposure to infectious organisms does build immunity but many viruses mutate and reexposure to the new strain requires another immune response new antibody production in addition antibody levels tend to decline with time and re innoculation is needed to keep the antibody levels high chronic overstimulation of the immune response can lead to immunosupression but this is rare and very unlikely to occur in children yes chronic use of antibiotics can have an adverse effect on the good bacteria that are supposed to be present in and on the body health effects of this depletion of the good bacteria is a very hotly debated topic in the medical community with most physicians seeming to discount any health effects of chronic antibiotic use a view that i do not support chronic infection in an adult or a child needs to be worked up in my opinion but most physicians feel that chronic infection in a child is normal because of both exposure and lack of prior immunity to many infectious diseases i do not share this view and there are some physicians who also suspect that diet plays a big role in infection frequency and severity exposure to an infectious agent does not have to result in a severe infection a strong immune response can minimize the length of time needed to deal with the infection as well as the symptoms associated with the infection there are five major nutrients that are responsible for a good strong immune response to infectious agents they are protein vitamin c vitamin a iron and zinc the american diet is not low in protein so this is rarely a problem but vitamin a vitamin c iron and zinc are often low and this lack of an adequate pool nutrient reserve can impair the immune response iron is know to be low in most kids as is vitamin a there are distinct biochemical tests that can be run to check the status of each of these nutrients in a patient who is having a problem with chronic severe infection serum ferritin for iron status dark adaptation for vitamin a status red blood cell zinc for zinc status and leckocyte ascorbate for vitamin c status i have attempted to work up posts on these five nutrients and their role in infection for this news group as well as the others that i participate in i can e mail you what i ve worked up so far but my best advice to you is to try to find a physician who recognizes the critical role that diet plays in the human immune response you may also be able to get help from a nutritionist anyone can call themselves a nutritionist so you have to be very carefull you want to find someone like myself who has had some formal training and education in nutrition many ph d programs in the u s now offer degrees in nutrition and that s what you need to look for some dieticians will also call themselves nutritionists but most dieticians have not had the biochemical training needed to run specialized nutritional assessment tests they are very good for getting general dietary advice from however
3 | picture our universe floating like a log in a river as the log floats down the river it occasionally strikes rocks the bank the bottom other logs when this collission occurs kinetic energy is translated into heat the log degrades gets scraped up and other energy translaions occur the distribution of damage to the log depends on the shape of the log however to a very small virus in a mite on the head of a termite in the center of the log the shock waves from the collissions would appear uniformly random in direction this is my theory for grb they are evidence of our universe interacting with other universes why not makes just as much sense as the grb coming from the oort cloud the log theory of universes can t be ruled out of course i m a layman in the physics world you physicists out there tell me about this
1 | i am not a battery expert but from recent reading a lead acid battery will self discharge at a relatively high rate and if stored in a discharged state will develop a condition i think is called sulfation in storage either the electrolyte should be removed and replaced for use fat chance i d ever do that at home or the battery should be stored on a trickle charge i have also i think read that the condition may be reversable if hooked up to a current limited charging circuit fro a long period of time the refernce i remember is to use c 50 where c is the amp hours as the charging circuit and leave it hooked up for weeks some of this may only apply to gel type cells but i suspect the same applies to the liquid type
3 | right now the hst sevicing mission is listed as 11 days before it was listed as 9 days they just kicked up the number of spacewalks to 5 after simulations indicated that it was not do able in 4 after all the space walking they are going to re boost the hst s orbit i think right now it s sitting at 180 miles up they would like 220 i don t know the exact orbit numbers i know when hst was first flown it was placed in the highest possible shuttle orbit now the shuttle can cary a thing called the edo pallet or extended duration orbiter pallet it s mostly lox lh for the fuel cells and rcs gear plus more o2 and canisters for the life support re breathers maybe more nitrogen too the limit on space walking is a function of suit supplies mass and orbiter duration in order to perform the re boost of the hst the oms engines will be fired for a long period now the shuttle is a heavy thing the hst isn t light either the amount of oms fuel needed to fly both up is substantial a small booster carried up and used to boost hst on it s own will weigh significantly less then the oms fuel required to boost both hst and shuttle for a given orbital change from what i understand the mass margins on the hst missions are tight enough they can t even carry extra suits or mmu s now if they used a small tug i would bet just a wild guess that the savings on amss margin would allow carrying the edo pallet extra suits more consumables parts for the flaky fgs sensor parts for the balky solar electronics and still enough for a double magnum of champagne or the hst could even get placed into some sort of medium orbit the reason they want a high orbit is less antenna pointing and longer drag life a whatever it is the problem in the tilt array is a big constraint on hst ops

3 | if this idea goes through it s the thin end of the wedge soon companies will be doing larger and more permanant billboards in the sky i wouldn t want a world a few decades from now when the sky looks like las vegas that would _really_ make me sad think for a moment about the technology required to do that by the time they could make the earth s sky look like las vegas the people could afford to go backpacking on the moon round trip costs for 500 kg to the moon would be about the same as 5000 kg in a low earth advertising orbit very roughly the same cost as a smallish billboard therefore if such ads were to become common place that would have to be a very low price this is nonsense its like saying that by the time commercials on television become commonplace every citizen will have their own hour long nationally broadcast tv program there s always been a problem of having to get away from civilization before you can really find natural scenery 100 years ago this usually didn t take a trip of over 5 miles today most people would have to go 100 miles or more if we ever get to the point where we have billboards on orbit that essentially means that no place on earth is still wild while that may or may not be a good thing the orbital billboards aren t the problem they are just a symptom of growing densely populated civilization banning such ads will not save your view of the night sky because by the time such ads could become widespread you will probably have trouble finding a place without street lights where you can _see_ the stars the rest of your post is strange mishmash of its already really bad and it doesn t really matter if it gets worse you should try to figure out what you are really arguing for kneejerk anti environ mentalism david

2 | point 1 i m beginning to see that part of the disagreements about the whole yeast issue is on differing perceptions and on differing meanings of words medical doctors have a very specific and specialized jargon necessary for precise communication within their field which i m fully cognizant of since i too speak jargonese when with my peers for the situation in sci med many times the words or phrases used by doctors can have a different and more specific meaning than the same word used in the world at large causing significant miscommunication one example word and very relevant to the yeast discussion is the exact meaning of systemic it is now obvious to me that the meaning of this word is very specific much more so than its meaning to a non doctor there is also the observation of this newsgroup that both doctors and non doctors come together on essentially equal terms which when combined with the jargon issue can further fan the flames this is probably the first time that practicing doctors get really beat up by non doctors for their views on medicine which they otherwise don t see much of in their practice except for the occasional difficult patient point 2 i understand the viewpoint among many practicing doctors that they will not prescribe any treatments therapies for their patients unless such treatments have been shown to be effective and the risks understood from well constructed clinical trials usually double blind or that such treatments therapies are part of an approved and funded clinical trial to these doctors to do any differently would in this belief system be unethical practice and it follows that any therapy not on the accepted list is therefore a non therapy it does not even exist nor does the underlying hypothesis or theory have any validity even if it sounds very plausible by extrapolation of what is currently known anecdotal evidence has no value either from a treatment point of view and by and large as a scientist myself i am glad that medical practice science takes such a rigorous approach to medical treatment however as also being a human being last i checked and having been one of those people that has been significantly helped by a currently unaccepted treatment where standard medicine was not able to help me has caused me to sit back and wonder if holding such an extreme and rigid scientific viewpoint is in itself unethical from humanitarian considerations after all the underlying intent of the scientific approach to medicine is to protect the health of the patient by providing the best possible care for the patient so the patient should come first when considering treatment what we need is a slightly modified approach to treatment that satisfies both the scientific and the humanitarian viewpoints in an earlier post i outlined a crazy idea for doing just that the gist of it was to give any physician freedom and encouragement by the medical community to prescribe alternate not yet proven therapies maybe supported by anecdotal evidence for patients who all avenues of accepted therapies have been exhausted and not until then the patient would be fully informed that such therapies treatments are not supported by the proper clinical trials and that there are real potential risks with real possibilities of no benefit derived from them this approach satisfies the need for scientific rigor it also satisfies the humanitarian needs of the patient and the reality is that many patients who have reached a dead end in the treatment of their symptoms using accepted medicine will go outside the orthodox medical community either to the doctors who are brave enough to prescribe such treatments at the risk of losing their license or worse to non doctors who have not had the proper medical training this approach also recognizes this reality and keeps the control more within orthodox medicine with the benefits that the information gleaned could help focus limited resources towards future clinical trials in the most productive way everybody wins in this admittedly rose colored approach i m sure there are real problems with this approach as well it is presented more as a strawman to stimulate discussion hopefully what i write here may give the sci med doctors a better idea as to why i am open to alternative therapies as well as why i have real difficulty read apparent hostility with the coldness of the 99 9 pure scientific approach to medicine i believe the best approach to medical treatment is one where both the humanitarian aspects are balanced with and by the scientific aspects anything else is just not good medicine imho just my nf leanings i guess comments jon noring charter member infj club

2 | i do not have enough medical expertise to have much of an opinion one way or another on hidden candida infections i can understand the skepticism of those who see this associated with various general kinds of symptoms while there is a lack of solid demonstration that this happens and causes such general symptoms to understand this skepticism one only needs to know of past failures that shared these characteristics with the notion of hidden candida infection there have been quite a few and the proponents of all thought that the skeptics were overly skeptical on the other hand i am happy to read that some people are sufficiently interested in this possibility spurred by suggestive clinical experience to research it further the doubters may be surprised it has happened before i realize that admitting ignorance in the face of ignorance may not endear me to those who are so sure they know one way or another and indeed perhaps some of them do know i am the one who is currently ignorant but i find this the most honest route and so i am happy with it

1 | what are people s opinions about laser detectors escort makes a laser detector the passport 1000 and claims it works fine however i ve talked to some people who have said that it will only work if you are lucky i e if the cop happens to point his laser at a car in front of you and the laser beam happens to reflect back to your detector otherwise it won t work regular radar of course travels in all directions hence it is more detectable any comments escort has a deal till the end of april i think where if you buy their wideband passport 3200 x k ka and laser detectors you ll save 60 off of buying them separately in this case the addition of the laser detector over the passport 3200 is only 40 i e passport 1000 normally costs 100 eddie gornish university of illinois center for supercomputing research development
3 | they weren t even carrying extra suits so how much mass is saved by not burning the oms that s the critical question my data shows that the oms engines hold 10 900 kg of propellant of that a substantial fraction is going to be used for the first oms burn the reentry burn and the reserve so pat tell us how much fuel the altitude change is going to take and how much the edo pallet bus 1 and extra parts are going mass if you can make the numbers work out _then_ i ll be interested after you show us that it can be done then tell us how much the edo pallet bus 1 and extra equipment is going to cost first while astronauts certainly have done evas with minimal planning that was because they _had_ to they don t like to do that as a general rule second remember why they had to improvise during intelsat 6 they were trying to attach a motor to a piece of hardware that wasn t designed to do that trying to shortcut the training is only going to make a repeat more likely third they don t have eight months they have however much time is left after someone comes up with a plan shows it can work and gets it approved you may think i have a pessimistic attitude i think it s realistic i m not saying that the engineering task is impossible few engineering tasks are what i m saying is that this is neither cost effective nor feasible under nasa management all they have to do is soup it up just what does that mean the second servicing mission is a contingency you have neither shown that it would be necessary without your plan nor that it would be unnecessary with your plan no pat i haven t forgotten no pat that s 500 million minus the cost of the new hardware minus the cost of the extra struff you want to bring along minus development and mangement costs minus extra operating costs tanstaafl i m sure that if you reread this you ll see that your argument is falacious pat not only is this messy and less reliable than a device that s _made_ to perform this task it also ignores the point there is a desire to have astronauts available so that if the door fails to open something can be done about it unless you can provide a very reliable way of reopening the door you haven t solved the problem

3 | well it s not that simple you re in earth s magnetic field and you don t generate electricity but it can be done the way you power things is with electricity so the answer to the first question is definitely yes if you meant to say propel rather than power the answer is sort of yes you can use interaction with the earth s magnetic field to get electrical power and there are potential applications for this however bear in mind that there is no free lunch the energy isn t coming from nowhere what such systems do is convert some of the energy of your orbital velocity into electrical energy there are cases where this is a useful tradeoff using power obtained in this way for propulsion is useful only in special situations however what you can do is get your power by some other means e g solar arrays and run the interaction with the magnetic field in reverse pumping energy into the orbit rather than taking energy out of it if you want more information trying looking up electrodynamic propulsion tether applications and magsails no a dragless satellite does not magically have no drag it burns fuel constantly to fight drag maintaining the exact orbit it would have if there was no drag this is why there are quotes around dragless

3 | wm hathaway comments i agree that the desire for beauty is valid but i think your desire to impose your vision of beauty is not you mention the age old desire to somehow get up there but ignore the beauty of the actual achievment of that vision you mention the beauty of a very dark sky not impeded by the effects of humans but ignore the beauty of the as dark as can be sky that is only visible from space a vision that we or at least our descendents may one day be able to see in part because of efforts that others call ugly one day i hope humans will be able to look out not upon half the heavens with only nature creted lights but upon all of the heavens with no lights if advertising in space can help us reach that goal it is no less beautiful for the way we reach it than the pristine sky of yesteryear or yester century which is totally unreachable one of the original conceptions of beauty in wetsern sculpture was a human form in the effort of striving to reach a goal i don t think there s any reason to believe that modernity has changed that just because it has changed the way we strive btw there are places that people haven t fouled sometimes they make it better tommy mac tom mcwilliams 517 355 2178 wk as the radius of vision increases 18084tm ibm cl msu edu 336 9591 hm the circumference of mystery grows

2 | can anybody out there provide me with any advice concerning the following two health problems first i was recently diagnosed using a ugi series as having a schatzki ring and small sliding hiatal hernia as i understand it the hernia is a relatively minor problem though i do occasionally have some nasty heartburn that is probably related to it the schatzki ring on the other hand is causing swallowing difficulty in particular if i m not careful about eating slowly and thoroughly chewing food food occasionally gets stuck before reaching my stomach this results in a period of painful spasms as the food attempts to pass the obstruction fortunately the food has always managed to pass but this is annoying and causes frequent discomfort my doctor wants to dilate the ring using the following procedure use an endoscope to examine the esophagus and stomach for any inflammation then cut through the ring and dilate it by passing some kind of balloon or something thru the esophagous i would like to know if anyone out there has had this or a similar procedure done if so was it painful successful etc also can anyone comment on safety advisability and success rate of this procedure has it become a common procedure i am kind of leery of having such an invasive sounding procedure performed for a currently non threatening condition such as this especially considering the possible side effects bleeding perforation reaction to anesthesia the second issue for the past 3 4 years i have had a large number of extra heartbeats in particular during the past month or so there has been a dramatic increase a holter monitor recently showed 50 pvc s in 24 hrs along with a few pac s many days there are far more than this however five to ten per hour all of them were isolated and the cardiologist indicated that such a number was normal it certainly doesn t feel normal in the past there have also been a couple of episodes of extended runs of these beats one of which lasted long enough to cause severe light headedness i am relatively young 30 ish thin and in good health recent bloodtests were all normal and do not smoke use drugs or caffeine etc i m willing to accept the extra beats as normal but don t want to ignore them if they might be some kind of warning symptom the number of pvc s seems to increase throughout the day and with exercise or something as simple as climbing some stairs also if i get up after sitting or lying down for a while i tend to get a couple of extra beats could they possibly be related to the esophagous problems both seemed to develop at about the same time thanks for any help advice

3 | stuff deleted would mr hart please explain how one could get every nation on earth and every corporation to agree that astronomers own the night sky without coercion remember that not every nation follows the english common law in most countries for most of history it was probably true that the rulers owned everything not explicitly owned by individuals even in north america where by the principle enunciated the aboriginal inhabitants should have owned everything when new arrivals wanted to use land and resources they just took it over in case mr hart hasn t noticed there is currently a brutal war going on in bosnia about who owns what of course if some friendly super power were to give an international astronomy organization some anti satelite missiles and also agree to defend it if attacked such a proposal might work but it would hardly be non coercive some of us nutty environmentalists think it might make sense first to try to mobilize public opinion against advertising in space and also to use governmental actions like taxing power for example to discourage them this of course would be too coercive for mr hart
3 | jonathan interesting questions some wonder whether or not the moon could have ever supported an atmosphere i d be interested in knowing what our geology environmental sciences friends think as for human tolerances the best example of human endurance in terms of altitude i e low atmospheric pressure and lower oxygen partial pressure is in my opinion to the scaling of mt everest without oxygen assistance this was accomplished by a team of mountaineers who trained at high altitudes for quite awhile i think a few months and then were flown by helicopter from that training altitude to the equivalent altitude on mount everest where they began the ascent of our planet s highest peak without oxygen tanks this is quite a feat of physiological endurance because if you or i tried to go to 20 000 feet and exert ourselves we would probably pass out get altitude sick and could even die from cerebral edema so this is the limit of low pressure high pressure situations would be limited by the duration of time which it takes to slowly acclimate to a higher pressure skin divers would know alot about high pressure situations and could tell you about how they safely make deep dives without getting the bends some military experiments have put people under several atmospheres of pressure not sure what the high limit was because the papers aren t in front of me usually at a certain point the nitrogen in the air becomes toxic to the body and you start acting idiotic divers call this nitrogen narcosis those afflicted can do very dangerous and irrational things like taking off a diving mask and oxygen tank in order to talk to fish at 100 feet under water hope any diving folk can elaborate on this matter as i am not a diving expert mars cannot support human life without pressurization because the atmosphere is too thin 1 100 th our earth s atmospheric density in addition the mars atmosphere is mostly carbon dioxide basically you would need a pressure suit there or you d die from the low pressure interesting huh
2 | no they do not work well my doctor started using one recently and i thought the concept was so amazing that i bought one too the thing works by reading the infrared emissions from the ear drum the ear drum is hotter than the ear canal walls so you have to point the thing very carefully this means tugging on the top of the ear to straighten out the ear canal then inserting the thing snugly then pushing a button unfortunately there are many things that can go wrong it is almost impossible to aim the thing correctly when you do it on yourself i get readings which differ from each other by up to 2 degrees and may differ from an oral thermometer by up to 2 degrees i talked to one of the nurses in my doctor s office recently about this and she said she didn t like them either for same reasons she did give me some instruction on how to tug on my ear and what correct insertion feels like but she said she thought it was impossible to do correctly on one s self she also said that she and other nurses had complained to the company about inaccurate readings and that someone from the company had told them to take great care to clean the infrared window at the end of the probe with alcohol from time to time she demonstrated this prior to reading my temperature and managed to get a reading within 0 5 degree of the oral temperature i took at home before driving to the dr s office i have also noticed tha some nurses click the button then remove the probe immediately this causes wrong readings in my experience you have to leave the probe in a good 1 to 2 seconds after clicking the button to get a good measurement the nurse i talked with agreed i suspect that many people don t realize this and therefore get bad readings for yet another reason

3 | i hate to belabor the obvious once again but if there had been an orbiter emergency in the early stages of the original hst deployment mission they would have had to land with hst in the bay indeed they were worried about that one concern was the possibility that they would lose a motor or something on the way up and make orbit but one that was too low to give hst a useful lifetime against atmospheric drag i believe the decision was to deploy hst even if the projected lifetime was as short as six months in fact we got an excellent orbit on the upper envelope of what the shuttle can do i have never heard of any serious consideration that hst might be brought down for refurbishment you would have the horrendous cost of transporting cleaning re testing and re certifying all the hardware on the ground in addition to the lost observing time and the cost of a second deployment mission with the risks that we might not get such a good orbit the second time and you would probably still need a third servicing mission in a few years as gyros and other components wear out better to have two servicing missions in space which could well happen than to bring hst down and take it up again
3 | _the_ problem with oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed it would have to involve new physics as far as i can tell closest to conventional oort sources is a model of b field pinching by comets it s got too many holes in it to count but at least it was a good try so you have a plausible model for grb s at astronomical distances i don t have any plausible models for grbs at any distances recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis which had a lot of problems anyhow we have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models hmm the superbowl burst has been claimed in press releases to cast doubt on the merging ns hypothesis from what i ve read and i haven t seen the papers only the press i d say it is consistent with some of the merging ns models a paper on the possibility of grb s in the oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service to get a copy of this here is the abstract of that paper indicator to these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration this is why the oort cloud of comets is kept on the list although there is no known mechanism for generating grbs from cometary nuclei unlikely as it may seem the possibility that grbs originate in the solar cometary cloud cannot be excluded until it is disproved this does not propose a _mechanism_ for grbs in the oort and no anti matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far as i understand annihilation spectra big difference that s ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution to the oort distribution when the oort distribution is not well known in particular comet aphelia which are not well known are not a good measure of the oort cloud distribution

3 | interstellar grains are not at all close to blackbodies the large grains have sizes of order 0 1 micron and absorb visible light with fair efficiency however at temperatures below 100 k 90 of the thermal emission will be beyond 22 microns where radiating efficiency is poor a small antenna cannot easily radiate at long wavelengths thus the grains must heat up more in order to radiate the energy they have absorbed moreover the iras observations had a maximum wavelength of 100 microns grains colder than 30 k will radiate primarily at longer wavelengths and iras would be relatively insensitive to them in the extreme limit grains as cold as 5 k will be almost undetectable by any conceivable observation worse still iras color temperatures are heavily contaminated by a population of small grains these grains have only perhaps 50 atoms and when they are hit by a single photon they heat up to temperatures of several hundred or 1000 k of course they cool quickly and then stay cold for a while but _when they are radiating_ the characteristic temperature is several hundred k even a small population of these grains can dramatically raise the observed average temperature a model for local infrared emission consistent with cobe data has three components these represent scattered radiation from zodiacal dust color temperature 5500 k thermal emission from zodiacal dust tc 280 k and thermal emission from galactic dust tc 25 k at the ecliptic poles the emissivities or dilution factors are respectively 1 9e 13 4e 8 and 2e 5 the first two are roughly doubled in the ecliptic plane to find the thermal equilibrium temperature we add up the dilution factor times the fourth power of temperature for all components then take the fourth root in the table below starlight comes from allen s number that stellar emission from the whole sky is equivalent to 460 zero mag stars with b v color of 0 75 no doubt careful work could do much better the person who suggested starlight had a dilution factor of e 4 must have been remembering wrong we would be cooked if that were the case in any event the energy density of starlight comes out about the same as that of the microwave background and i believe that to be correct dilution temp dt 4 microwave background 1 2 7 53 galactic dust 2e 5 25 8 zodiacal dust emission 6e 8 280 369 zodiacal dust scattering 3e 13 5500 275 starlight 1e 13 5500 92 797 the fourth root of 797 is 5 3 k outside the solar system the result would be 3 5 k i find these results surprising especially the importance of zodiacal dust but i don t see any serious mistakes

2 | sure there are quacks there are quacks who don t treat and quacks who treat one s that refuse to diagnose and ones that diagnose improperly there are lucky quacks and unlucky quacks smart quacks and dumb ones there are people ahead of their time with unprobable or unproven theories and rationals there are ill reasoned absurd theorists sometimes it s hard to tell who s who reading a book of ancient jokes it seems that doctors called other doctors quacks in babylon arguments abound when there aren t any firm answers plenty of illnesses aren t or can t be diagnosed or treated but i think it s better to argue against the theory as was originally done with postings on candida a month or so ago stating the facts usually works better than simply asserting an opinion about someone s competency and you can t convince everybody sometimes a correct diagnosis takes years for people they don t run into a doctor who recognizes the disease they haven t developed something recognizable yet or they have something that no one is going to recognize because it hasn t been described yet sometimes they get a cure sometimes the illness wears out sometimes they stumble on an improper diagnosis with the right treatment sometimes they find it s incurable there is no profit in a patient accepting a hopeless attitude about an illness unless it s a rock solid diagnosis of terminal disease it s is more like ly that a person will find a cure if they keep looking

3 | ahh perhaps that s why we ve astronomers have just built 2 10 meter ground based scopes and are studying designs for larger ones seriously though you re never going to get a 10 meter scope into orbit as cheaply as you can build one on the ground and with adaptive optics and a good site the difference in quality is narrowed quite a bit anyway also scopes in low orbit like hubble can only observe things continuously for 45 minutes at a time which can be a serious limitation i sure as hell does if the point of light is half a degree in extent and as bright as the moon have you ever noticed how much brighter the night sky is on a moonlit night existing satellites are points of light but an advertising sign that appeared as a point would be useless so i rather think these will appear larger than a typical satellite also satellite tracks are ruining lots of plates in the current palomar sky survey what deparment are you in anyway philosophy you obviously are not qualified to speak about astronomy

2 | do i assume correctly from the above aricle that your mother has a historyy of cancer i was just wondeing since you mentioned thhat she has an oncologist a bone scan is a nuclear scan thperson receivving the scan is gven a dose of a radioactive tracer and an imaging device is used to track the distribution of the tracer wwithin the body the tracer is usually given intravenously iv this means that the physician or his assistant will insert a needle into a vein and inject medicine into the vein after a few minutes has passed for the tracer to circulate through the body the person is scanned with an imaging device to detect high concentrations of the tracer the radiologist or doctor is looking for areas that take up more of the radioactive tracer or less of it as far as pain the only pain comes from the needle stick that is required to start the iv line what the doctor is probably looking for are changes in the bones that may have resulted from cancer this is also why i was wondering if your mother has had cancer since cancer can spread from one site and wind up in the skeletal system i hope i have answered some of your questions feel free to e mail me if you have more questions related to the bone scan or anything else related to your mother s care i m a newly graduated nurse and i enjoy sharing information with other people to help them understand things that they did not know about before my thoughts are with you both

2 | you might look for an allergy doctor in your area who uses sublingual drops instead of shots for treatment you are given a small bottle of antigens 3 drops are placed under the tongue for 5 minutes my allergy to bermuda grass was neutralized this way throughout the treatment process i had to return to the doctor s office every month for re testing and a new bottle of antigens after the allergy was completely neutralized a bottle of maintenance antigens lasts me about 4 months the sublingual drops are then taken 3 times per week and costs 20 so the cost is less than shots and it is more convenient just to take the drops at home

2 | well that post was not that accurate people with early life hernias are felt to have a congenital sack that promotes the formation of hernias the hernias of later life may be more associated with chronic straining however the risk of damage to the intestine without an operation is high enough that it ought to be repaired the risk of cancer is probably no higher than the general population but since you are near 40 it would be sensible to have some sort of cancer screening such as a flexible sigmoidoscopy sorry for the misleading info
2 | well i think you might want to visit a doctor who is familiar with sleep disturbances because antihistamines only help induce sleep when they re used intermittently they lose their sedative effect if they re used on a nightly basis their anticholinergic effects drying of secretions relaxing effects on smooth muscle can be problematic in some people such as those with glaucoma or prostate enlargement antihistamines like diphenhydramine benadryl or doxylamine unisom are potent sedatives which are useful occasionally chlorpheniramine chlor trimeton is said to be less sedative but 8mg seems to work well in some people both chlorpheniramine and doxylamine have long half lives compared to diphenhydramine and so may produce a residual hangover or drugged feeling the next morning

1 | hi folks i borrowed a vhs tape from a friend and it has a warning in the begining saying that attempts to copy the tape will result in destroying the copy and the original i found this unbelievable as playing and recording are two different processes however i ve never seen this tape being sold anywhere so i don t want to take the chance even it s small anyone has experience in this kind of self destructing video tapes thanks in advance
2 | but after you have taken antihistamines for a few nights doesn t it start to have a paradoxical effect i used to take one every night for allergies and couldn t figure out why i developed bad insomnia finally figured out it was the antihistamines i would fall asleep for a few minutes but would awaken at the drop of a pin a little later and could not get back to sleep i don t have that problem since i stopped the antihistamines at bedtime

1 | judging by your sig you are trying to make some kind of game cartridge information of how to build an eeprom cartidge for the vectrex is available via anonymous ftp at csus edu since you ve chosen the 27c512 you are probably trying to make a multicart to do this simply 1 load the game images into the eeprom at 2000 4000 etc your eeprom burner software may allow this or you will have to assemble the images into one file yourself with suitable gaps 2 wire up the cartridge with the lower address bits going to the game console and the high bits going to switches to choose between games to directly answer your question above the pin that kicks up the address is simply another address line

1 | for those who are interested the fcc does indeed care about cable leakage particularly into the aviation nav band or leakage that is causing interference to other services part 76 611 details specific limits to acceptable leakage and measurement technique if you will clearly document your problem and measurement technique a signal level meter with dipole is the normal approach remember to correct between measurement data and microvolts per meter and fax or mail the details to mr john wong cable branch fcc 1919 m st nw wash dc and a copy of your letter to the local cable company you will get results in fact the cable company will probably start treating you much better when they realize you have figured out how to get the fccs attention what is important is to document your case as it relates to the applicable rules however the cable company is required to at least check out every complaint of leakage they must file with the commission and maintain on premises a yearly measurement report that details the results of leakage testing but remember call the cable company first and give them a chance to work to correct the problem before contacting the commission i am in the business of measuring cable system leakage via the airborne method

1 | one of the most popular methods of course is the password check where they ask you for a word from page x line y and word z but this is pitifully simple to remove unless you throw some checksums into the main part of your program and some self rewriting code to confuse some people also make sure that your program can not be run out a debugger another method of course is to not even make bad sectors on the original disk just write a certain key to a certain unallocated sector to help you here you also must do the code protection schemes mentioned in the first paragraph make sure you also fill the rest of the unallocated parts of the disk with garbage as well or they wanna be crackers can just look for the junk in some random sector like you mentioned there are the laser holed disks and hardware keys but they are both expensive and a pain in the butt for the end user which you is the opposite of what you want another configuration that can be used is to save the configuration of the machine that it is being installed to in the most undecipherable format you can think of if the program does not find that this is the same system it requests being installed by the original disk again the original disk should be encrypted compacted have many sectors that should be checked and anything else you can think of to make sure that the original cannot be copied once again you must put code encryption self rewriting code and multiple crc checks in the program to make sure that it does not get changed among other things this also protects your program from virii if the program detects a change in its code tell the user that a virus has been detected in the program tell them the program is virus secure and remember you have helped the world kill some pirating and kill some viruses feel good i hope that i have helped have fun knock some cracking out well you can t do it everything that can be written can be cracked but you ll piss em off in the process goodbye what is the program that will be sold george gruschow death do you gronk ag625 yfn ysu edu ggruscho nyx cs du edu

2 | i don t like the term quack being applied to a licensed physician david questionable conduct is more appropriately called unethical in my opinion i ll give you some examples 1 prescribing controlled substances to patients with no demonstrated need other than a drug addition for the medication 2 prescribing thyroid preps for patients with normal thyroid function for the purpose of quick weight loss 3 using laetril to treat cancer patients when such treatment has been shown to be ineffective and dangerous cyanide release by the nci these are errors of commission that competently trained physicians should not committ but sometimes do there are also errors of omission some of which result in malpractice suits i don t think that using anti fungal agents to try to relieve discomfort in a patient who you suspect may be having a problem with candida or another fungal growth is an error of commission or omission healers have had a long history of trying to relieve human suffering some have stuck to standard approved procedures others have been willing to try any reasonable treatment if there is a chance that it will help the patient the key has to be tied to the healer s oath i will do no harm but you know david that very few treatments involve no risk to the patient the job of the physician is a very difficult one when risk versus benefit has to be weighed each physician deals with this risk benefit paradox a little differently some are very conservative while others are more agressive an agressive approach may be more costly to the patient and carry more risk but as long as the motive is improving the patient s health and not an attempt to rake in lots of money through some of the schemes that have been uncovered in the medicare fraud cases i don t see the need to label these healers as quacks or even unethical what do i reserve the term quack for pseudo medical professionals these people lurk on the fringes of the health care system waiting for the frustrated patient to fall into their lair some of these individuals are really doing a pretty good job of providing alternative medicine but many lack any formal training and are in the business simply to make a few fast bucks while a patient can be reasonably assured of getting competent care when a liscenced physician is consulted this alternative care area is really a buyer s beware arena if you are lucky you may find someone who can help you if you are unlucky you can loose a lot of money and develop severe disease because of the inability of these pseudo medical professional to diagnose disease which is the fortay of the liscened physicians i hope that this clears things up david

1 | assuming you are refering to standard pots or ground start lines if you are looking at loop start lines under idle conditions the ring conductor is the one with approximately 48 to 52 vdc with respect to ground while the tip conductor is at or very near ground potential be sure to reference the telco ground when taking your measurements if you are dealing with ground start lines under idle conditions the ring conductor will be the one with approximately 48 to 52 vdc while the tip conductor would look like it s floating you may see some potential from line capacitance it will bleed off over time remember to use the telco ground as your reference when making measurements

3 | there would be some point to doing long term monitoring of things like particles and fields not to mention atmospheric phenomena however there is no particular plan to establish any sort of monitoring network to be precise there is no particular plan period this is a large part of the problem in this context it s not surprising that unexciting but useful missions like this get short shrift at budget time the closest approach to any sort of long term planetary monitoring mission is the occasional chance to piggyback something like this on top of a flashier mission like galileo or cassini it is most unlikely that there is much happening on pluto that would be worth monitoring and it is a prohibitively difficult mission to fly without new propulsion technology something the planetary community has firmly resisted being the guinea pigs for the combined need to arrive at pluto within a reasonable amount of time and then kill nearly all of the cruise velocity to settle into an orbit is beyond what can reasonably be done with current that is 1950s vintage propulsion most of this can be done just about as well from earth the few things that can t be can be done better from a voyager like spacecraft that is not constrained by the need to enter orbit around a planet
2 | three possible results after interview 1 rejection outright 2 acceptance outright 3 the infamous wait list if you are on a wait list your entrance into medical school is dependent upon some other applicant withdrawing their acceptance this can happen as late as day 1 of starting classes you can always call the admissions office the secretaries should have some idea of when a decision might be made on your application be calm respectful and friendly secretaries have more power than you might realize and you never know could be the dean of admissions answering the phone if you don t get in this year sit down and re evaluate yourself your motives desires and goals that are directing you into medicine your academic and extracurricular accomplishments make a decision about whether you really want to be a medical doctor i had classmates who dropped out in the first semester of med school because they found it was not what they wanted to do i have friends who applied four years in a row before they were accepted medicine as a career is a choice you must make for yourself don t be pushed into it because of your parents family significant other if you still want to be a medical doctor determine how you can improve your application a letter of recommendation from a professor who knows you well and can give an honest positive recommendation is far better than one from a big shot famous professor who only vaguely remembers your face also don t be afraid to ask these people if they can give you an honest and positive recommendation give them a chance to say no sorry instead of the medical school saying no sorry i have turned down writing recommendations for some students because i did not know them well enough to make any meaningful comments and some because i honestly could not recommend them at that point rewrite your personal statement take it by an english professor or some other friendly person with skill and experience in writing and proof reading and get their criticism both about what you are saying as well as how you say it review your academic accomplishments if your grades are poor in some area don t be afraid to spend some time in further coursework evidence of determined committment will help here if you filled your pre medicine curriculum with gut courses it usually shows look at your extracurricular involvements participating in local philanthropic or service organizations is a plus substantial leadership roles in an organization help also beware of resume padding such things are not difficult to spot and weed out overall a clear conception of where you wish to head and why you want to get there combined with an honest self appraisal of skills and aptitude will be the best path to take in applying to any program medical or what have you good luck with the process as tom petty says the waiting is the hardest part at least emotionally

2 | does anyone know of research done on the use of haldol in the elderly does short term use of the drug ever produce long term side effects after the use of the drug my grandmother recently had to be hospitalized and was given large doses of haldol for several weeks although the drug has been terminated she has changed from a perky slightly senile woman into a virtual vegetable who does not talk to anyone and who cannot even eat or brush her teeth without assistance it seems incredible to me that such changes could take place in the course of just one and one half months i have to believe that the combination of the hospital stay and some drug s are in part catalysts for this any comments

3 | i would have to say that the greatest philosopher title would have to go to plato since the whole enterprise of philosophy was essentially defined by him although he got most of his answers wrong he did definitively identify what the important questions are i think it was descartes who said that all philosophy is just a footnote to plato if i were to choose which philosopher made the most important advances in human knowledge over his lifetime that s simple it is aristotle this is so much the case that many simply refer to him as the philosopher regarding nietzsche he s one of the most entertaining although since his ideas were so fragmented and since his life was cut short it is doubtful that his influence as a philosopher is likely to be very extensive 500 years from now they ll probably still be reading him in 500 years though as for modern philosophers i would have to say that kant was the most influential since he had such a strong influence on almost everyone who came after him and unfortunately they maintained his errors and amplified them over time i would say that the most influential american philosopher would have to be dewey but as to the question of what philosopher will be most highly regarded in 500 years it may very well be ayn rand who in every important respect was american but was born in russia but i guess that remains to be seen

3 | ken your arguments are thoughtful but you are going up against the big boys if you re tackling henry allen sherzer will doubtless chime in on the subject of staggering operational costs too good luck son ahem the russians are in the free world now or at least it would be politically correct to contend so it will be tough to make dc x succeed and to turn it into an operational orbital vehicle doubtless it will fail to meet some of the promised goals the reason people are so fond of it is that it s the only chance we have now or will have for a long time to come to develop a launch vehicle with radically lower costs there is no shuttle successor in funded development nasp is dwindling away and als nls spacelifter sure as hell aren t gonna knock any zeroes off that 2000 3000 per pound cost part of the blame for this must be placed on a shuttle program that consumes many annual billions of the er free world s available space cash as you will no doubt hear from many correspondents in the days to come dc x is an attempt to break out of the vicious cycle by keeping development costs low and flying incremental x plane hardware it s been to my mind incredibly successful already they ve built a complex prototype in under 600 days for under 60 megabucks i would have been extremely skeptical that this could be accomplished in 1990s america never mind flying the thing getting a successor funded or building the dc y i m sure you know well that launch costs are the basic problem for any expansion of astronautics i don t see a realistic prospect for beating down those costs for multi ton payloads anywhere else if the dc flops it ll be business as usual in space the nineties and the double oughts will look just like the seventies and eighties a prospect too depressing to bear pegasus represents another assault on the problem from a different direction it doesn t lower cost per pound but it offers an orbital launch for under ten megabucks it s creating its own market for small payloads i read the magazines and i ve attended the last two iafs there are plenty of engineers with paper ideas for cheaper launch systems some of them as good as or better than ssto there is no sign in today s world that any of these designs will be allowed anywhere near an assembly line deleting some things i m not going to prove tonight strawman is anybody seriously proposing this references please the dc must be developed in the real world funding climate which includes a nasa ferociously committed to continuing shuttle operations as well as the bird in the hand argument your common sense tells you if dc y flies at all it flies alongside the shuttle not instead of it also of course dc y and its operational descendants will be useful for a wide variety of jobs even if they are not man rated if a dc x successor can fly a 10 000 kg payload for 1m or even 5m rather than the 40m it now costs more people will be able to afford more payloads for the same money you can fly several satellites instead of one big outfits can fly multi satellite series little outfits will be able to fly spacecraft of their own instead of begging a ride this is just supply and demand you should be able to convince yourself that point 4 will be true assuming dc makes a big difference in costs do you have some reason to think not

3 | this does not propose a _mechanism_ for grbs in the oort and no anti matter annihilation does not fit the spectra at least as far as i understand annihilation spectra big difference that s ignoring the question of how you fit a distribution to the oort distribution when the oort distribution is not well known in particular comet aphelia which are not well known are not a good measure of the oort cloud distribution merging neutron stars is at least a mechanism with about the right energy except it doesn t explain why there is no apparent correlation with galaxies or galaxy structure there is no mechanism for getting all the energy out in gamma rays with any significant amount of baryons around there will be a lot of pair production which makes a plasma which thermalizes the energy it has trouble generating enough energy to explain the most powerful bursts 10 52 53 ergs it happens too fast compared to the burst duration and it is hard to make tight binaries of neutron stars another cosmological mechinism is the catalytic conversion of a neutron star to a strange star or the merger of two strange stars but that uses pretty far out physics my point is that we don t have a good mechanism at any distance so grb s are likely to be happening by an unknown mechanism so we can t rule out the oort cloud what would be the spectrum of an event which converts a comet to strange matter the spectra for primordial black holes eating comets and antimatter comets colliding with matter comets aren t quite right but perhaps there is an unusual mechanism which modifies the spectrum the energy matches very well for both of these mechanisms according to trevor weeks if the tunguska meteorite was a mini black hole collision with the earth then there are likely to be enough mini black holes around that the rate for bh comet collisions matches the grb rate well the fact that we don t know the distribution of comets in the oort cloud isn t a reason to rule them out it makes it harder to rule them out the point of the cited paper was that if we assume they got the right distribution for the oort cloud it is hard but not impossible to match that up with the distribution of grb s if they got the wrong distribution for the oort cloud they can t constrain any oort cloud grb s at all
2 | chronic persistent hepatitis is usually diagnosed when someone does a liver biopsy on a patient that has persistently elevated serum transaminases months after a bout of acute viral hepatitis or when someone is found to have persistently elevated transaminases on routine screening tests the degree of elevation in the serum transaminases can be trivial or as much as ten times normal other blood chemistries are usually normal as a rule patients with cph have no clinical signs of liver disease chronic active hepatitis can also be asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic at least initially and that s why it s important to tell them apart by means of a biopsy the patient with cph only needs to be reassured the patient with cah needs to be treated i just went back to the chapter in cecil on chronic hepatitis it seems that indeed most cases of cph are persistant viral hepatitis whereas there are a multitude of potential and probable causes for cah viral drugs alcohol autoimmune etc physicians seem to have a variety of thresholds for electing to biopsy someone s liver personally i think that if the patient is asymptomatic with only slight transaminitis and normal albumin and pt one can simply follow them closely and not add the potential risks of a biopsy others may well biopsy such a patient thus providing these samples for study it would be interesting to see if anyone s done any decision analysis on this

2 | agents of the original poster did not say why his mother had been in hospital but i can answer a few general points elderly patients may exhibit a marked difficulty in coping after being in hospital for a few days the drastic change of environment will often unmask how marginally they have been coping at home even young people find the change unsettling though we have thought that this decrement in function after say anaesthesia and surgery for a fractured hip a common event in the elderly was due to anaesthesia there is good evidence that the change of situation is much more important some hospitals have tried a rapid transit system for hip fractures aiming to have the patient back at home within 24 hours of admission the selection of the anaesthetic has no effect on the ability to discharge these patients early anaesthetists who work with the elderly which is almost all of us generally take care to tailor the choice and dose of drugs used to the individual patient even so there is some evidence that full mental recovery may take a surprisingly long time to return this is the sort of thing which is detected by setting quite difficult tasks not the gross change that the original poster noted haloperidol haldol tm is a long acting drug the plasma half life of the drug is up to 35 hours if the decanoate a sort of slow release formulation is used it may be weeks the elderly are sensitive to haloperidol for a number of reasons without knowing more it is hard to comment

similar to the natural hormone progesterone protects women from pregnancy for three months per injection the hormone is injected into the muscle of the arm or buttock where it is released into the bloodstream to prevent pregnancy it is more than 99 percent effective this drug presents another long term effective option for women to prevent pregnancy said fda commissioner david a kessler m d as an injectable given once every three months depo provera eliminates problems related to missing a daily dose depo provera is available in 150 mg single dose vials from doctors and clinics and must be given on a regular basis to maintain contraceptive protection if a patient decides to become pregnant she discontinues the injections as with any such products fda advises patients to discuss the benefits and risks of depo provera with their doctor or other health care professional before making a decision to use it depo provera s effectiveness as a contraceptive was established in extensive studies by the manufacturer the world health organization and health agencies in other countries u s clinical trials begun in 1963 also found depo provera effective as an injectable contraceptive the most common side effects are menstrual irregularities and weight gain in addition some patients may experience headache nervousness abdominal pain dizziness weakness or fatigue the drug should not be used in women who have acute liver disease unexplained vaginal bleeding breast cancer or blood clots in the legs lungs or eyes the labeling advises doctors to rule out pregnancy before prescribing the drug due to concerns about low birth weight in babies exposed to the drug hicnet medical newsletter page 14 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 recent data have also demonstrated that long term use may contribute to osteoporosis the manufacturer will conduct additional research to study this potential effect depo provera was developed in the 1960s and has been approved for contraception in many other countries the upjohn company of kalamazoo mich which will market the drug under the name depo provera contraceptive injection first submitted it for approval in the united states in the 1970s at

the food and drug administration today announced that it will soon publish new rules to shed the approval of drugs for patients with serious or life threatening illnesses such as aids cancer and alzheimer s disease these final rules will help patients who are suffering the most serious illnesses to get access to new drugs months or even years earlier than would otherwise be possible said hhs secretary louis w sullivan m d the effort to accelerate fda review for these drugs has been a long term commitment and indeed a hallmark of this administration these rules establish procedures for the food and drug administration to approve a drug based on surrogate endpoints or markers they apply when the drug provides a meaningful benefit over currently available therapies such endpoints would include laboratory tests or physical signs that do not in themselves constitute a clinical effect but that are judged by qualified scientists to be likely to correspond to real benefits to the patient use of surrogate endpoints for measurement of drug efficacy permits approval earlier than if traditional endpoints such as relief of disease symptoms or prevention of disability and death from the disease are used the new rules provide for therapies to be approved as soon as safety and effectiveness based on surrogate endpoints can be reasonably established the drug s sponsor will be required to agree to continue or conduct postmarketing human studies to confirm that the drug s effect on the surrogate endpoint is an indicator of its clinical effectiveness one new drug zalcitabine also called ddc was approved june 19 using a model of this process for treating the human immunodeficiency virus hiv the cause of aids accelerated approval can also be used if necessary when fda determines that a drug judged to be effective for the treatment of a disease can be used safely only under a restricted distribution plan the new rules will help streamline the drug development and review process without sacrificing goad science and rigorous fda oversight said fda commissioner david a kessler m d while drug approval will be accomplished faster these drugs and biological products must still meet safety and effectiveness standards required by law hicnet medical newsletter page 16 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 the new procedures also allow for a streamlined withdrawal process if

retinal disease national retinitis pigmentosa foundation neutrophilic factors rescue photoreceptor cells in animal tests baltimore md researchers at the university of california san francisco and regeneron pharmaceuticals inc nasdaq regn have discovered that certain naturally occurring substances known as neurotrophic factors can prevent the degeneration of light sensing cells in the retina of the eye the degeneration of these cells known as photoreceptors is a major cause of visual impairment this research published to in the december issue of the proceedings of the national academy of science pnas holds promise for people who may lose their sight due to progressive retinal degeneration currently no drug treatment for retinal degeneration exists it is estimated that 2 5 million americans have severe vision loss due to age related macular degeneration and 100 000 americans are affected by retinitis pigmentosus a hereditary disease that causes blindness in addition each year more than 15 000 people undergo surgical procedures to repair retinal detachments and other retinal traumas the research was funded in part by the rp retinitis pigmentosa foundation fighting blindness

survival promoting activity of a number of naturally occurring substances experimental rats were exposed to constant light for one week eyes that had not been treated with an effective factor lost most of their photoreceptor cells the rods and cones of the retina after light exposure brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf and ciliary neurotrophic factor cntf were particularly effective in this model without causing unwanted side effects other factors such as nerve growth factor ngf and insulin like growth factor igf 1 were not effective in these experiments discussing the research dr jesse

number 11 april 25 1993 affluent diet increases risk of heart disease research resources reporter written by mary weideman nov dec 1992 national institutes of health high fat high calorie diets rapidly increase risk factors for coronary heart disease in native populations of developing countries that have traditionally consumed diets low in fat these findings according to investigators at the oregon health sciences university in portland have serious implications for public health in both industrialized and developing countries this study demonstrates why we can develop coronary heart disease and have higher blood cholesterol and triglyceride levels it shows also the importance of diet and particularly the potential of the diet to increase body weight thereby leading to a whole host of other health problems in developing countries and affluent nations as well explains principal investigator dr william e connor head of the section of clinical nutrition and lipid metabolism at oregon health sciences university over the past 25 years dr connor and his team have characterized the food and nutrient intakes of the tara humara indians in mexico while simultaneously documenting various aspects of tarahumara lipid metabolism these native mexicans number approximately 50 000 and reside in the sierra madre occidental mountains in the state of chihuahua the tarahumaras have coupled an agrarian diet to endurance racing probably as a result coronary heart disease which is so prevalent in western industrialized nations is virtually non existent in their culture loosely translated the name tarahumara means fleet of foot reflecting a tribal passion for betting on kickball races in which participants run distances of 100 miles or more while kicking a machete carved wooden ball the typical tarahumara diet consists primarily of pinto beans tortillas and pinole a drink made of ground roasted corn mixed with cold water together with squash and gath ered fruits and vegetables the tara humaras also eat small amounts of game fish and eggs their food contains approximately 12 percent of total calories as fat of which the majority 69 percent is of vegetable origin dietician martha mcmurry a coinvestigator in the study describes their diet as simple and very rich in nutrients while low in cholesterol and fat the tarahumaras have average plasma cholesterol levels of 121 mg dl low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol levels of 72 mg dl and high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol levels of 32 to 42 mg dl all of those values are in the good low risk range according to the researchers elevated cholesterol and ldl cholesterol levels are considered risk factors for heart hicnet medical newsletter page 20 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 disease hdl cholesterol is considered beneficial in previous studies the tarahumaras had been found to be at low risk for cardiac disease although able to respond to high cholesterol diets with elevations in total and ldl cholesterol clinical research center dietitian mcmurry and coinvestigator maria teresa cerqueira established a metabolic unit in a jesuit mission school building near a community hospital in the small village of sisoguichi food was weighed cooked and fed to the study participants under the investigators direct supervision ensuring that subjects ate only food stipulated by the research protocol fasting blood was drawn twice weekly and plasma samples were frozen and shipped to dr connors laboratory for cholesterol triglyceride and lipoprotein analyses regular measurements included participant body weight height and triceps skin fold thickness thirteen tarahumaras five women and eight men including one adolescent were fed their native diet for 1 week followed by 5 weeks of an affluent diet in this study we went up to a concentration of dietary fat that was 40 percent of total calories this is the prototype of the holiday diet that many americans consume a diet high in fat sugar and cholesterol low in fiber elaborates dr conners such dietary characteristics are reflected in the cholesterol saturation index or csi recently devised research dietitian sonja conner working with dr connor the csi is a single number that incorporates both the amount of cholesterol and the amount of saturated fat in the diet csi indicates the diet s potential to elevate the cholesterol level particularly the ldl dr connor explains the tarahumaran diet averages a very low csi of 20 dr connor s affluent diet used in the study ranks a csi of 149 the experimental design of this study reflects the importance of establishing baseline plasma lipid levels typical of the native diet before exposing subjects to the experimental diet the standard curve relating dietary food intake to plasma cholesterol demonstrates a leveling off or plateau for consumption of large amounts of fat changes in dietary fat and or cholesterol in this range have little effect on plasma levels you must have the baseline diet almost free of the variables you are going to put into the experimental diet the framingham study for example did not discriminate on the basis of diet between individuals who got heart disease because the diet was already high in fat all subjects were already eating on a plateau dr connor says after 5 weeks of consuming the affluent diet the subjects mean plasma cholesterol levels had in creased by 31 percent primarily in the ldl fraction which rose 39 percent hdl cholesterol increased by 31 per cent and ldl to hdl ratios changed therefore very little plasma triglyceride levels increased by 18 percent and subjects averaged an 8 pound gain in weight according to dr connor lipid changes occurred surprisingly soon yielding nearly the same results after 7 days of affluent diet as after 35 days hicnet medical newsletter page 21 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 the increase in hdl carries broad dietary implications for industrialized nations we think hdl cholesterol increased because we increased the amount of dietary fat over the fat content used in the previous tarahumara metabolic study in that study we saw no change in hdl levels after raising the dietary cholesterol but keeping the fat relatively consistent with native consumption in the present study we increased fat intake to 40 percent of the total calories we reached the conclusion in the tarahumara study that hdl reflects the amount of dietary fat in general and not the amount of dietary cholesterol hdl must increase to help metabolize the fat and it increased quite a bit in this study dr connor explains low hdl in the tarahumarans is not typically an important predictor of coronary heart disease because they do not normally consume large amounts of fat or cholesterol hdl remains an important predictor to americans because of their usual high fat intake dr connor recommends a diet for americans that contains less than 20 percent of total calories as fat less than 100 mg of cholesterol and a csi around 20 varying in accordance with caloric needs such a diet is low in meat and dairy fat high in fiber dr connor also comments on recent suggestions that americans adopt a mediterranean style diet the original mediterranean diet in its pristine state consisted of a very low intake of fat and very few animal and dairy products we are already eating a lot of meat and dairy products simply to continue that pattern while switching to olive oil is not going to help the situation the world health organization who is focusing much attention on the emergence of diseases such as coronary heart disease in nations and societies undergoing technological development dr connor says that coronary heart disease starts with a given society s elite who typically eat a different diet than the average citizen if the pattern of afluence increases the entire population will have have a higher incidence of coronary heart disease which places a termendous health care burden on a society who would like the developing countries to prevent coronary heart disease so they can concentrate on other aspects of their economic development and on public health measures to improve general well being rather than paying for unnecessary expensive medical technology dr connors says the overall implication of this study is that humans can readily move their plasma lipids and lipoprotein values into a high risk range within a very short time by an affluent excessive diet the present rate of coronary heart disease in the united states is 30 percent less than it was 20 years ago so a lot has been accomplished we are changing rapidly he concludes hicnet medical newsletter page 22 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 general announcments publications for

1 | much deleted about assembly in usa vs other i wish to focus on the subject of warm running amplifiers there is a correclation between warm running amps and good sound or in your words it does have a bearing on now i don t suggest that everyone run out and create combination stove amplifiers that will degrade lifespan but a cold running circuit is much more suceptible to temperature variation with varrying current than is a warm running one and since junction resistance is a function of temperature this has a detrimental effect on linearity a few facts bias points vary with temperature junction resist varrie with temp adcom products do not run class a if you still don t beleive this assertion consider the warm up requirements for most good test equipment or better yet just listen to an amplifier warm up on many designs its quite audible on mine about 20 minutes for the output stage many hours for the drivers fortunately the drivers are not switched in any experiment or when drawing conclusions from listening betcareful to seperate the effect of device temperature from bias idle current level both have a positive correlation with low distortion and good sound quality and high bias results in warmer operation all other factors being equal

362 no 6420 p 504 volvovitz franklin and smith gale the questions raised by moore et al about recombinant gp160 envelope glycoprotein precursor from hiv 1 produced by microgenesys are advantages rather than disadvantages write franklin volvovitz and gale smith of microgenesys in meriden conn moore et al says that gp160 in a baculovirus expression system does not bind strongly to the cd4 receptor and that this recombinant gp160 does not stimulate the same antibodies as the hiv 1 virus does in natural infection but vaccination with recombinant gp160 in patients infected with hiv 1 broadens hiv 1 specific envelope directed immune responses including crossreactive antibodies to gp160 epitopes and cd4 and cd8 cytotoxic t cell responses volvovitz and smith claim that they never intended their gp160 molecule to be identical to the native protein antibody responses against native hiv 1 proteins including the types described by moore et al exist in nearly all aids patients but do not prevent hicnet medical newsletter page 42 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 progression of hiv disease in addition the binding of gp120 or gp120 antibody complexes to cd4 has been shown to interfere with antigen specific activation of cd4 cells and trigger programmed cell death in vitro which may contribute to the pathogenesis of hiv infection the absence of cd4 binding by the microgenesys gp160 vaccine may therefore be viewed as an added safety feature phase i studies have demonstrated stable cd4 counts stimulation of cytotoxic t cells and the suggestion of restoration of immune function based on these and other clinical results microgenesys gp160 was chosen by researchers at the karolinska institute in sweden for the first phase iii vaccine therapy studies conclude

percent of total iga in milk being secretory iga breastfeeding protects infants against gastrointestinal and respiratory illnesses in both normal and uninfected children born to hiv positive mothers the italian national registry of aids discovered that breastfed hiv 1 infected children had a longer median incubation time 19 months than bottlefed infants 9 7 months breastfed children also had a slower progression to aids there is no agreement on which antibodies offer protection against hiv 1 infection studies of the biological properties of milk from 15 hiv 1 infected women showed the

medical newsletter page 43 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 et al of the university of miami school of medicine in miami fla the researchers contacted all patients treated by a dentist with aids and attempts were made to contact all patients for hiv testing living patients with newly detected hiv infection were interviewed and dna sequence analysis was performed to compare genetic relatedness of their hiv to that of the dentist death certificates were obtained for deceased patients and the medical records of those with diagnoses suggestive of hiv disease or drug abuse and those dying under the age of 50 years were examined in detail there were 1 192 patients who had undergone 9 267 procedures of whom 124 were deceased an examination of the death certificates of patients identified five who had died with hiv infection all of whom were either homosexuals or iv drug users the researchers were able to detect 962 of the remaining 1 048 patients and 900 agreed to be tested hiv infection was reported in five of the 900 patients including four who had clear evidence of risk factors for the disease one patient who had only a single evaluation by the dentist denied high risk behavior comparative dna sequence analysis showed that the viruses from the dentists and these five patients were not closely related the study suggests the potential for hiv transmission from a general dentist to his patients is minimal in a setting in which universal precautions are strictly observed conclude dickinson et al april 22 1993 aids patients are susceptible to recurrences of tb study says washington post 04 22 93 p a13 tuberculosis can strike aids patients more than once which makes the resurging health hazard harder to control according to a study published in today s new england

fight off a new tb infection doctors found peter m small of the howard hughes medical institute at stanford university director of the study said that in order to protect against reinfection it may be

proof that hiv is the cause of aids the hypothesis that drug use leads to aids will hopefully become a hindrance to the physiologically azt and psychologically positive aids test toxic public health initiatives writes peter duesberg of the university of california berkeley in the lancet s march 13 issue schechter et al call duesberg s hypothesis that injected and orally used recreational drugs and azt lead to aids a hindrance to public health initiatives however their hypothesis that hiv is the cause of aids has not attained any public health benefits the u s government spends 4 billion annually but no vaccine no therapy no prevention and no aids control have resulted from work on this hypothesis schechter et al conclude that hiv has a key role in cd4 depletion and aids based on epidemiological correlations with antibodies against hiv and with self reported recreational drug use among homosexuals from vancouver however their survey neglects to disprove duesberg s drug aids hypothesis because it does not provide controls i e confirmed drug free aids cases and because it does not quantify drug use and ignores azt use altogether to refute duesberg s hypothesis schechter would have to produce a controlled study demonstrating that over a period of up to 10 years hiv positive patients who use recreational drugs or azt or both have the same aids risks as positives who do not do so the 10 year period is claimed by hicnet medical newsletter page 45 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 proponents of the hiv hypothesis to be the time needed for hiv to cause aids alternatively

for serum hiv p24 antigen and had circulating antibodies to p24 sera from all three patients obtained at the end of ifn treatment and testing in enzyme linked immunosorbent assay contained high titres of antibodies reacting to a sequence located in the aminoterminal of the beta chain of all human hla class ii antigens homologous to a sequence located in the carboxy terminus of hiv 1 gp41 these autoantibodies which also recognize native class ii molecules and may contribute to the elimination of cd4 t cells in vivo were at low tires 50 100 in all three patients six months after stopping ifn such autoantibodies were not detected in 28 other patients with hiv infection and hcv related cah treated with ifn and who did not experience cd4 t cell loss in some hiv 1 infected individuals through the amplification of harmful autoimmune reactions the subjects had a1 b8 dr3 and b35 dr1 hla antigen combinations which are linked with a more rapid fall in cd4 cell counts and clinical progression of

hiv risk factor was found from medical record review patients were interviewed using a standardized questionnaire once std clinic and other medical records were reviewed 29 men and 7 women were reclassified into other hiv transmission categories after adjustments were made for the reclassification the percentage of aids cases reported from palm beach and broward counties between january 1

1 | two or three years ago i saw a report on tv about a company that had developed a method of making solar cells on a flexible substrate my failing memory has convinced me it was some flexible metal i now have an application that requires a flexible solar cell and was hoping someone out in netland knows something about this company or a similar product any help would be greatly appreciated
1 | i would also be interested in the application here i work with a dance and technology program and want to build something to track dancers on a 30 foot wide stage from 50 feet away could make for some interesting choreography light and sound could be controlled directly by the position of a dancer on stage or by the number of dancers on stage neat you could even build a spotlight that follows the dancer around on stage can you tell us more about what you re doing sounds like a very cool program
1 | i hope david isn t going to be too upset with me for sticking my nose in here again but here goes it isn t the average temperature that is the key factor here but rather which is better at transferring the heat out of the presumably warmer than ground temperature battery call it a question of thermal conductivity or of insulating ability or thermal mass whatever you like question why does a concrete floor feel cooler than the surrounding dirt when you place your hand on it
2 | all right listen up what are the possibilities of transmission through swimming pool water especially if the chlorination isn t up to par i ve heard of community swimming pools refered to as public urinals so what else is going on no dice as soon as the sperm cells hit the water they would virtually explode the inside of the cell is hypertonic and since the membrane is semipermeable water would rush in and cause the cell to burst
3 | i don t think a reboost exercise is analogous to a shuttle landing launch in terms of stresses misalignments etc i would think of the reboost as a gentile push where a landing then launch as two jolts which would put more mechanical stress on the instruments additionally there might be a concern about landing loads to the shuttle in the event of a laden landing finally probably some thought went into possible contamination problems if the instruments came back to earth of course the cost of two shuttle launches _is_ a good reason to avoid something that might be done in one shuttle launch here s hoping cepi s gang gets the job done right the first time

1 | hi i have a few questions about laying out a pcb i am using easytrax for dos which is a great program but what my question is when laying out traces what thickness should they be i am mainly designing low voltage low current boards for micro controller apps what should pad sizes be for resistors i will be turning to a commercial pcb maker to produce 1 s of these boards and i was wondering what is the minimum distance traces should be from each other well any info would be great thanks anton
2 | i don t believe any state licenses herbologists or iridologists
3 | i think to some extent this is a case of stooping to their level you assume that the general public can t handle the truth and then based on this assumption go for the fluff arguments then someone who can understand a good argument comes along and asks why don t you just develop the spinoffs or why can t we just get our spinoffs from some other program like the military there are some good arguments for space development without relying on its side effects i m not ignoring the value of spinoffs i simply think that the general public deserves more credit than you give them and if you re going to use spinoffs you better make darn sure you are right teflon has been around since before nasa as i understand it velcro was conceptualized by a french doctor who went walking in the woods and took the trouble to wonder how burrs stick to your clothes certainly velcro was available on hiking equipment by the early to mid sixties i would need to see some good evidence before i believe that either of these would not be here today without nasa

1 | hi i am looking an integrated circuits for my z80 based computer the circuit is called z80 sti serial timer interrupt mk3801 and made by mostek mostek is called sgs thompson today i have been in contact with sgs thompson unfortunately they me told that z80 sti is obsolete so my question is if anyone know if i can get hold of that circuits are there any companies that specialize in selling circuits that are no longer in production i have contacted several electronic brokers in sweden but without any success i would appreciate if you could give me hint where i should continue looking even companies in the united states would be fine since this circuit is pretty crucial to me thanks in advance

2 | speaking from experience one doesn t need drugs to become disoriented during hospital stays i was in hosp for 5 days in late jan what with general noise at all hours of night staff coming every time i turned over or whatever to check me out i didn t get much sustained sleep at night spent days groggy dozing and all it was from my perspective was that i was tired
1 | i ve come across a circuit from integrated circuit systems inc called a gsp500 this chip genlocks a vga card to a dual input ntsc signal the output from this chip is basicly a pixel clock and has various speeds i notice that it outputs a 28mhz clock can this output be used on an amiga system and must it be ntsc vga or can it be ntsc ntsc any simple circuits to boost an ntsc to a vga signal need to genlock a laser disc to my 31khz video john

2 | about two years ago i posted the following i am planning to write a new book called great canadian scientists please forward your nominations to me shell cs sfu ca the rules are that the person must be a canadian citizen they don t have to be born in canada or even live in canada but they must have or have had if they are dead canadian citizenship while they are were great canadian scientists about 70 people have been nominated already and they are listed at the end of this posting i m not quite sure what should constitute greatness and there may be a gray area here if you have any ideas on criteria for greatness i would be pleased to hear them in any event please nominate people even if you are not sure they are great i would like as big a list as possible please give me a name and email address phone number or mail address so that i can contact the person if you don t know any of the above then give me their last known whereabouts also please give your reason for why you think the person should be considered a great canadian scientist after i have the list i will choose about six of the most interesting ones and do in depth biographies of those individuals in the style of tracy kidder s soul of a new machine or some other dramatic technique the rest of the great canadian scientists will appear in an appedix with one paragraph biographies if you have any other ideas about this project i am interested to hear them so far i have received 68 nominations as follows first name last name nominator famous for sid altman kuszewski john catalytic rna nobel chem 89

growing nicely it s amazing to see just how much was discovered by canadians actually there are many more who were born in canada but became americans after graduate school please note a lot of people have nominated alexander graham bell but i feel he was really a scottish american with a summer home in canada now i know this is debatable but please don t nominate him again if anyone can fill in some of the question marks on the list please drop me a line that was two years ago since then i have received a grant from science culture canada a division of supply and services canada to research the book since my old posting the book has evolved into an educational book for kids aged 9 14 though this may change again it will have about 40 two page spreads with a large graphic in the middle and text graphic boxes all around on the following subjects vital statistics and photo of the scientist personal statement from the scientist narrative of a few moments in the life of the scientist what i was doing when i was 12 so you want to be a insert kind of scientist experiment you can do there will be an appendix with 100 200 more scientists with one paragraph biographies who didn t quite make it to the double spreads the whole thing will then be published on cd rom with video and sound clips for added richness i am looking for a cd rom publisher as well the text part may also be available on the canarie electronic highway being developed in canada as well i am still looking for a publisher though penguin canada came close to being it hope to find one soon i would like to again ask for more nominations especially in the pure sciences of physics chemistry and biology also criticisms of the list are welcomed also women and french canadian scientists are needed i hope this posting will get others to nominate more great canadian scientists and to discuss what is great what is canadian and what is scientist please respond to shell sfu ca or barry shell 604 876 5790

2 | my girlfriend just started taking this drug for her migranes it really helped her get through the rebound withdrawl when she got off analgesics she doesn t have a mail account but asked me to forward this glaxo is the distributor imitrex is the drug s brand name it works she can call her pharmacy for more info the miracle drug has been used for years in europe and for some time in canada trials in the u s were completed and the drug hit the us market at the end of march some pharmacies don t stock it yet presently it needs to be injected subcutaneously although testing is starting with a nasal spray form it mimics serotonin its molecular structure that fits onto pain receptors looks identical to serotonin on a model i saw
3 | heck some of his ships were loaners one was owned by a basque you know one of those groups that probably crossed the atlantic _before_ columbus came along
3 | no no no the previous one was called smiley 1992 qb1 smiley and 1993 fw karla note that neither name is official it seems the discoverers have an aversion to the designation scheme
3 | the following is what they feed to us most has been posted already but there are a number of items not seen here yet redesign activities update following is the weekly status on redesign based on information provided by nasa headquarters the station redesign team srt provided a detailed status report to the advisory committee on the redesign of the space station on april 22 the day long meeting was held in anser facilities in crystal city va topics covered by the srt included a preliminary mission and goals statement for the space station science technology and engineering research the assessment process and the design approach discussions on management options and operations concepts also were held the design teams then presented the three options under study option a modular buildup pete priest presented the a option priest said the team is working to define a station that meets cost goals and has identified three distinct phases of evolution power station human tended and permanent presence the team will define the minimum capability needed to achieve each phase the total cost of each phase and the achievable capability for budget levels the a option uses current or simplified freedom hardware where cost effective and is considering other existing systems such as the so called bus 1 spacecraft the orbiter and spacelab the power station capability could be achieved in 3 flights with freedom photo voltaic modules providing 20 kw of power 30 day shuttle spacelab missions docked to the power station are assumed for this phase human tended capability would be provided by the addition of the u s common module module which adds subsystems and 9 payload racks and docking ports for esa and japanese laboratories 60 day missions with the orbiter docked to the station are assumed for this phase different operation utilization modes are being studied for this phase option b freedom derived mike griffin presented the status of option b activities griffin detailed the evolution of the freedom derived option from initial research capability to human tended capability to permanent human presence capability to two fault tolerance and finally permanent human capability griffin also outlined proposed systems changes to the baseline program with minor changes to the communications and tracking system crew health care system and eclss and a major change to the data management system initial research capability would be achieved with 2 flights to 28 5 degree inclination 3 flights to 51 6 degrees and consist of an extended duration orbiter spacelab combination docked to a truss segment with 2 photo voltaic arrays providing 18 75 kw of power human tended capability would be achieved in 6 flights and add truss segments and the u s lab permanent human presence capability would be achieved in 8 flights with two orbiters providing habitation and assured crew return two fault tolerance achieved in 11 flights would build out the other section of truss with another set of pv modules thermal control and propulsion systems the freedom derived configuration could achieve an international complete state with 16 flights three more flights to bring up the habitat module a third pv array and two assured crew return vehicles acrv would complete the permanent human capability with international stage griffin told the redesign advisory committee that eliminating hardware would not by itself meet budget guidelines for the freedom derived option major reductions or deferrals must occur in other areas including program management contractor non hardware early utilization and operations costs he said option c singe launch core station chet vaughn presented option c the single launch core station concept a shuttle external tank and solid rocket boosters would be used to launch the station into orbit shuttle main engines would be mounted to the tail of the station module for launch and jettisoned after et separation the module 23 feet in diameter and 92 feet long would provide 26 000 cubic feet of pressured volume separated into 7 decks connected by a centralized passageway seven berthing ports would be located at various places on the circumference of the module to place the international modules and other elements this can would have two fixed photo voltaic arrays producing approximately 40 kw of power flying in a solar interial attitude in his closing comments to the redesign advisory committee bryan o connor said a design freeze would be established for the 3 options on april 26 so that detailed costing of the options can begin the next meeting with the redesign advisory committee will be may 3 russian consultants arrive in u s a delegation of 16 russian space experts arrived in the u s on april 21 and briefings to the srt by members of the russian team began on the 22nd the group includes russian space agency general director y m koptev and v a yatsenko also of the rsa others on the team include representatives from the ministry of defense the design bureau salyut the institute of biomedical problems the ministry of foreign affairs npo energia and tsnijmash the russian team briefed the srt on environmental control and life support system docking systems the proton launch vehicle mir operations and utilization and the soyuz tm spacecraft the russian consultants are available to the srt to assess the capabilities of the mir space station and the possible use of mir and other russian capabilities and systems as part of the space station redesign they will be available to the srt through may 5 management and operations review continues work continued in the srt subgroups the management group under dr walt brooks is working to develop a family of options that solve the current problems and build a foundation for the transition to development and operations various management options have been developed including lead center with the center director in the programmatic chain of command host center with the program manager reporting directly to an associate administrator skunk works dedicated program office with a small dedicated co located hand picked program office combine space station with shuttle with the space station becoming an element of the current program major tune up to current organization with current contracts and geographical distribution maintained but streamlined the operations group under dr john cox is building on the work of the operations phase assessment team lead by gene kranz of nasa jsc which had already begun a comprehensive review of operations and had concluded in its preliminary results that significant cost reductions are possible as part of its work the operations group has identified teams of agency experts to develop detailed evaluations of each design in the areas of assembly and operations utilization maintenance and logistics and testing and ground operations what s in the week ahead the design support teams will provide a comprehensive status of their option to the station redesign team on monday and tuesday at which point the design will be frozen to begin the detailed cost assessment also this week the team will begin preparing for the next round of discussions with the redesign advisory committee to be held may 3 dr shea steps down dr joe shea stepped down as director of the station redesign team on april 22 and bryan o connor will take over the activities of the team dr shea submitted his resignation as assistant deputy administrator for space station analysis but will continue to serve as a special advisory to nasa administrator goldin and be available to consult with the srt mr goldin accepted the resignation so that a request from dr shea to reduce his workload could be accommodated key milestones the key dates for the srt as they are currently being carried on the schedule are april 26 design freeze on options for costing april 27 design support team present selected options to srt may 3 status report to redesign advisory committee may 15 interim report by redesign advisory committee june 7 final report to redesign advisory committee

2 | i have osteoarthritis and my huband has just been diagnosed with diabetes type ii i guess no insulin i ve been trying to read up on these two conditions and what really surprises me is how few experiments have been done and how little is known losing weight appears to be imperative for diabetes and advisable for arthritis at least for women with arthritis but of course the very conditions that make weight loss advisable are part of the reason for the weight gain for myself i m almost afraid to lose weight because no matter how gentle and sensible a diet i use the last one was 1800 2000 calories in about eight small meals the weight won t go off gradually and stay off instead it drops off precipitously and then comes back on with much interest like bread on the waters with this experience it s hard to be encouraging to my husband all i can suggest is to make it as gradual as possible meanwhile some experts recommend no sugar others no fat others just a balanced diet it s almost impossible to tell from their writings which parts of their recommendations are supposed to help the condition and which are merely ideas the expert thinks are nifty is it my imagination or are these very old conditions very poorly understood is it just that i m used to pediatrician talk it s strep give him this and he ll get well and so my expectations are too high
3 | having read in the past about the fail safe mechanisms on spacecraft i had assumed that the command loss timer had that sort of function however i always find disturbing the oxymoron of a no op command that does something if the command changes the behavior or status of the spacecraft it is not a no op command of course this terminology comes from a jet propulsion laboratory which has nothing to do with jet propulsion
3 | someone from nasa posted that there were very significant mass margins on the hst re boost mission a while back i had asked why not carry the edo pallet up and the answer was the mass margins were tight enough they weren t even carrying extra suits where s wingo when you need him come on knock that s t off you forget that during skylab they did overnight mission planning for the repair eva s also during theøä intelsat mission they did overnight wetf simulations i somehow think they could train up a new eva in 8 months and as for building hardware anything can be built if you want it bad enough you forget the bus 1 is already built all they d ahve to do is soup it up even test it on a delta mission don t get into this mode of negativism besides at the rate missions slip the discovery won t launch on this mission until march that s almost a year ah but how much more expensive is the second hst servicing mission you forget there is a bum fgs the solar array electronics are getting hinky and there is still 8 months until the servicing mission the time for the space walks are growing rapidly this was orignally planned out as 3 spacewalks now they are at 5 eva s with 3 reserve walks if the smt can avoid a second servicing mission that s 500 million saved if the weight savings means they can sit on orbit for 30 days and handle any contingency problems that s quite a savings of course there wasn t any need for the saturn v after apollo too as for the problems with the aperture door i am sure they can work out some way to handle that maybe a plug made from frozen ice it ll keep out any contamination yet sublime away after teh boost
2 | here is a press release from huntington medical research institutes new method for diagnosing alzheimer s disease discovered at huntington medical research institutes results to be reported to national desk health writer contact john lockhart or belinda gerber 310 444 7000 or 800 522 8877 for the huntington medical research institutes los angeles april 28 a new method for diagnosing and measuring chemical imbalances in the brain which lead to alzheimer s disease and other dementias has been discovered by researchers at the huntington medical research institutes hmri in pasadena calif results of their research will be reported in the may issue of the scientific journal radiology using an advanced form of magnetic resonance imaging mri called magnetic resonance spectroscopy mrs a research team led by brian d ross m d d phil conducted a study on 21 elderly patients who were believed to be suffering from some form of dementia the exams used standard mri equipment fitted with special software developed at hmri called clinical proton mrs clinical proton mrs is easily applied giving doctors confirmatory diagnoses in less than 30 minutes an automated version of clinical proton mrs called proton brain examination probe reduces the examination time yet further providing confirmatory diagnoses in less than 10 minutes by comparison the current standard of care in testing for alzheimer s disease calls for lengthy memory function and neuropsychological tests which can be very upsetting to the patient are not definitive and can only be confirmed by autopsy in addition to alzheimer s disease the new clinical proton mrs exam may have applications in diagnosing other dementias including aids related dementia parkinson s disease and huntington s disease we ve developed a simple test which can be administered quickly and relatively inexpensively using existing mri equipment fitted with either the mrs or probe software said dr ross adding this will help physicians to diagnose alzheimer s earlier and intervene with therapeutics before the progression of the disease causes further damage to the delicate inner workings of the brain dr ross and his hmri team measured a family of chemicals in the brain known as inositols and myo inositol mi acted as a marker in the study in comparison to healthy patients those diagnosed with alzheimer s showed a 22 percent increase in mi while their level of another chemical called n acetylaspartate naa was significantly lower indicating a loss of brain stimulating neurons believed to be associated with the progression of the disease current drug therapy for alzheimer s disease is widely considered to be inadequate this is attributable dr ross believes to the theory that alzheimer s is caused by an interruption in the transmission of the chemical acetylcholine to the nerve cells this belief has been adhered to over the last 15 years and consequently most drugs to treat alzheimer s were based on the changing receptors for acetylcholine physicians have a real need for a test to differentiate alzheimer s from other dementias to provide the patient and his or her family with a firm diagnosis and to monitor future treatment protocols for the treatment of this disease for this reason we consider this test a major advancement in medicine said bruce miller m d a noted neurologist at harbor ucla mrs researcher and a co author of the study other members of the hmri research team included rex a moats ph d truda shonk b s thomas ernst ph d and suzanne woolley r n the probe software can be fitted on the approximately 1 200 general electric mri units currently in use in the united states and will be configured for other manufacturers mri units soon for interviews with dr ross advance copies of the radiology may issue and other information please contact john lockhart or belinda gerber for hmri at 310 444 7000 or 800 522 8877 q a on alzheimer s disease what is alzheimer s disease and how is it caused alzheimer s disease ad is an incurable degenerative disease of the brain first described in 1906 by the german neuropathologist alois alzheimer as the disease progresses it leads to loss of memory and mental functioning followed by changes in personality loss of control of bodily functions and eventually death how many people does it affect alzheimer s disease affects an estimated 4 million adults in the united states and is the fourth leading cause of death taking approximately 100 000 lives each year while alzheimer s debilitates its victims it is equally devastating both emotionally and financially for patients families ad is the most common cause of dementia in adults symptoms worsen every year and death usually occurs within 10 years of initial onset what are its signs and symptoms although the cause of ad is not known two risk factors have been identified advanced age and genetic predisposition the risk of developing ad is less than one percent before the age of 50 yars old but increases steeply in each successive decade of life to reach 30 percent by the age of 90 in patients with familial ad immediate family relatives have a 50 percent chance of developing ad one of its first symptoms is severe forgetfulness caused by short term memory loss dr herman weinreb of the school of medicine at new york university says whether forgetfulness is a serious symptom or not is largely a matter of degree and suggests the following criteria forgetting the name of someone you see infrequently is normal forgetting the name of a loved one is serious forgetting where you left your keys is normal forgetting how to get home is serious doctors suggest that people with severe symptoms should be evaluated in order to rule out alzheimer s disease and other forms of dementia 30
2 | partial deletion nice explanation except that it isn t n hydroxylation that causes the formation of the n acetyl p benzoquinone imine napqi but rather a direct two electron oxidation in addition there is one school of thought that contends that oxidative stress rather than arylation of protein is the more critical factor in the hapatotoxcity of acetaminophen as far as drug toxicities go acetaminophen has and continues to be one of the most intensely scrutinized an excellent recent review of the topic can be found in vermeulen bessems and van de straat molecular aspects of paracetamol induced hepatotoxicity and its mechanism based prevention drug metabolism reviews 24 3 367 407 1992 acetaminophen is known as paracetamol in europe i couldn t agree with you more about what an awful way to die a toxic dose of acetaminophen causes i ve heard a number of descriptions by physicians associated with poison control centers and they describe a lingering very painful death
3 | jeremy are you talking about a single batse component or the whole thing you could propose a batse probe launch two or three with ion drive on various planetary trajectories your resolution increaces the more they re spaced apart you could probably cheaply eject them from the solar system with enough flybys and patience things would start out slow then slowly get better and better resolution
2 | my opinion for what it s worth is that 40 x rays is way too many guidleines have been set on the number of dental x rays and chest x rays that one should have over a given period of time because of all the environmental factors that can cause cancer in humans ionizing radiation is one of the most potent splits dna and causes hydroxyl free radical formation in tissue cells ultasound like that used in seeing the fetus in the uterus has been shown to be extremely good at picking up tumors in the prostate and gallstones in the gallbladder but kidney tissue may be too dense for ultrasound to work for kidney stones any radiologists care to comment most stones will pass but it s a very painful process unlike gallstones i don t think that there are many drugs that can help dissolve the kidney stone which is probably calcium oxalate vitamin c and magnesium have worked in rabbits to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the aterial wall i have no idea if a diet change or supplementation could speed up the process of kidney stone passage but i m pretty confident that a diet change and or supplementation can prevent a reoccurance if surgery is being contemplated the stone must be in the kidney tubule a second opinion is a good idea because there are better less damaging ways to break up the stone if it s logged within the kidney sonic blasts hmo s are notorious for conservative care and long waits for expensvie treatments my condolences to your friend
2 | one of the responsibilities of a licensed physician is to read the medical literature to keep up with changes in medical practice all the clamor over laetril resulted in the nci spending quite a bit of money on clinical trials which proved to me anyway that laetril was ineffective against cancer a physician who continued to use it when better more effective treatments are available may deserve to be called a quack anti fungals are in a different class the big question seems to be is it reasonable to use them in patients with gi distress or sinus problems that could be due to candida blooms following the use of broad spectrum antibiotics gorden rubenfeld through e mail has assured me that most physicians recognize the chance of candida blooms occuring after broad spectrum antibiotic use and they therefore reinnoculate their patients with good bacteria to restore competetion for candida in the body i do not believe that this is yet a standard part of medical practice he deals with critical care patients where fungal infection systemic is a real problem and just because he tries to keep good bacteria in his patients does not mean that all physicians do this i think that aspergillis is more likely to be found in the sinus mucus membranes than is candida women have been known for a very long time to suffer from candida blooms in the vagina and a women is lucky to find a physician who is willing to treat the cause and not give give her advise to use the otc anti fungal creams since candida colonizes primarily in the ano rectal area gi symptoms should be more common than vaginal problems after broad spectrum antibiotic use the problem we have here david is proof that gi discomfort can be caused by a candida bloom the arguement is that without proof no action is warrented medicine has not and probalby never will be practiced this way there has always been the use of conventional wisdom a very good example is kidney stones conventional wisdom because clinical trails have not been done to come up with an effective prevention was that restricitng the intake of calcium and oxalates was the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming clinical trials focused on drugs or ultrasonic blasts to breakdown the stone once it formed through the recent new england j of medicine article we now know that conventional wisdom was wrong increasing calcium intake is better at preventing stone formation than is restricting calcium intake the conventional wisdom in animal husbandry has been that animals need to be reinnoculated with good bacteria after coming off antibiotic therapy if it makes sense for livestock why doesn t it make sense for humans david we are not talking about a dangerous treatment unless you consider yogurt dangerous if this were a standard part of medical practice as gordon r says it is then the incidence of gi distress and vaginal yeast infections should decline

3 | if you re doing large scale satellite servicing being able to do it in a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense the question is whether anyone is going to be doing large scale satellite servicing in the near future to the point of justifying development of such a thing you d almost certainly use air given that you have to pressurize with something safety considerations strongly suggest making it breathable even if the servicing crew is using oxygen masks for normal breathing to avoid needing a ventilation system it s nice if the hangar atmosphere is breathable in a pinch it makes mask functioning much less critical

3 | a bright light phenomenon was observed in the eastern finland on april 21 at 00 25 ut two people saw a bright luminous pillar shaped phenomenon in the low eastern horizont near mikkeli the head of the pillar was circular the lower part was a little winding it was like a monster they told they were little frightened soon the yellowish pillar became enlarged a bright spot like the sun was appeared in the middle of the phenomenon at last the light landed behind the nearby forest now there was only luminous trails in the sky which were visible till morning sunrise the same phenomenon was observed also by jaakko kokkonen in lappeenranta at 00 26 ut he saw a luminous yellowish trail in the low northeastern horizont the altitude of the trail was only about 3 4 degrees soon the trail began to grow taller a loop was appeared in the head of the trail it was like a spoon this lasted only 10 seconds now the altitude was about five degress above horizont he noted a bright spot at the upper stage of loop the spot was at magnitude 2 the loop became enlarged and the spot was now visible in the middle of the loop a cartwheel shaped trail was appeared round the bright spot after a minute the spot disappeared and only fuzzy trails were only visible in the low horizont luminous trails were still visible at 01 45 ut in the morning sky the phenomenon was caused by a russian rocket i don t know if there were satellite launches in plesetsk cosmodrome near arkhangelsk but this may be a rocket experiment too since 1969 we have observed over 80 rocket phenomena in finland most of these are rocket experiments military missile tests barium experiments and other chemical releases during these years we have observed 17 satellite launches leo wikholm

2 | isn t there a relatively new treatment for kidney stones involving a non invasive use of ultra sound where the patient is lowered into some sort of liquid when he she undergoes treatment i m sure i ve read about it somewhere if i remember it correctly it is a painless and effective treatment the use of shock waves not ultrasound to break up stones has been around for a few years depending on the type of machine and intensity of the shock waves it is usually uncomfortable enough to require something the high power machines cause enough pain to require general or regional anesthesia afterwards it feels like someone slugged you pretty good
2 | a good source of information on burzynski s method is in the cancer industry by pulitzer prize nominee ralph moss interesting what book got moss the pulitzer nomination none of the flyers for his books mention this and none of the cancer chronicle newsletters that i have mention this either also a non profit organization called people against cancer which was formed for the purpose of allowing cancer patients to access information regarding cancer therapies not endorsed by the cancer industry but which have shown highly promising results all of which are non toxic moss is people against cancer s director of communications people against cancer seems to offer pretty questionable information not exactly the place a cancer patient should be advised to turn to most maybe all of the infomation in their latest catalogue concern treatments that have been shown to be ineffective against cancer and many of the treatments are quite dangerous as well sdb
2 | unfortonately that truly is about the best summation of the research that there is advantages stated of circumcison included probably prevention of penile cancer which interestingly occurs mostly in men whose personal hygiene is exceptionally poor simplicity of personal hygiene prevention of urinary tract infections and prevention of a unretractible foreskin disadvantages include infection from the procedure pain etc i apologize i am trying to pull this off the top of my head i will post what i discovered in research i did a paper on the topic in my research class in nursing school it really is a decision that is up to the parents some parents use the reasoning that they will look like daddy and like their friends as justification there is nothing wrong with this just be sure it is what you want to do since it is rather difficult to uncircumcise a male although a major surgical procedure exists as long as your membranes have not broken and you have not had any problems with your pregnancy it should be ok to sit in a tub of water however i would recommend using your own bathtub in your own home it is nearly impossible to guarantee the cleanliness and safety of public hot tubs a nice warm bath can be very relaxing especially if your back is killing you and it would possibly be advisable to avoid bubble bath soap esp if you are prone to yeast infection hope these tips help you some
3 | i don t think this will work still the same in space integration problems small modules especially the bus 1 modules the mol would be bigger also budget problems may end up stalling developemnt a small undersized station wont have the science community support program effeciencies may cut costs but the basic problems with freedom remain in space integration too many flights too build not enough science retrurn essentialy 5 billion to build mir i think had nasa locked onto this design back in 1984 with scarring to support a truss for real expandability we d be looking at a flying space station this looks the most realistic to me imho but i dont know if there is enough will power to toss the cdr d existing hardware and then take a 1 3rd power cut and do it this way the core launch station has a lot of positive ideas you could stick in more hatches for experimental concept modules like the et derived workshops or inflatable modules pat sad but true epitaph killed by mis management
2 | the diarrhea problem what diarrhea problem first candidal overgrowth is not a frequent problem during antibiotic therapy and not all cases of antibiotic related diarrhea have anything to do with candida but a case of vaginal candidiasis or oral thrush after antibiotic therapy isn t going to surprise anyone either that s not what people are disagreeing with oh really where d you come up with this you know it s really appalling to see you try to comment authoritatively on clinical matters in a bizarre synthesis from reading reports in the literature bobbing for citations in the research literature isn t medicine i hope you re not giving the wrong idea to your medical students
1 | for those who would like to know the 6507 was a 6502 without irq or nmi and with only 13 address lines giving 8k memory space didn t know about it being called the 6526 thats the cia found in the commodore 64 i don t believe this chip existed when the 2600 was around the tia was mapped into the bottom 128 bytes of page 0 and shadowed in the bottom 128 bytes of page 1 to get an image on the screen you had to wait until the raster line your picture started at load bitmaps for this line into the sprite registers tell them what x positions to take how many duplicates you wanted etc then do it all again for the next line this took all of the processor s time during the visible portion of the display the ram was mapped into the top 128 bytes of page 0 and shadowed in page 1 the 6502 has a zero page addressing mode on most instructions that is both shorter and faster than the normal ones so it is important on a machine like this to have the scratchpad ram in page 0 unfortunately it also wants its stack to be in page 1 the stack pointer is 8 bits and the high byte of the address is hardwired to 1 the iot section was mapped into page 2 somewhere 2 8 bit i o registers can t remember if each bit could be independantly set to i or o like the 6522 and 6526 and 1 8 bit timer with a programmable prescaler i think this was some power of 2 there were no interrupts in the system so many games would set up the timer at some known time go away and do something else for a while then sit and wait for the timer to run down there was no logic in the box to do address decoding the riot had at least 2 chip select pins probably one active high one active low and i imagine the tia was much the same various address lines were fed directly to chip selects the 6507 likes to have rom right at the top of memory so the 2600 had to use roms with active high chip selects not exactly normal so some cartriges had a 7404 in them to convert this to the more usual active low chip select
3 | 1 please take this out of sci space 2 ayn rand was not only born in russia but educated there a lot of her philosophy reflects not only a european education but a reaction against certian events in russia while she lived there i ve heard that to the extent there is a division of modern philosophy between the continental and british american schools rand belongs in the former in terms of methodology et al even though she was trying to say things that would belong in the latter school i e she was trapped in the language of kant and hegel even though she was trying to say at times much different things
1 | tis only a gleam in my eye at this point i have yet to chose a tracking method the initial requirement was to design a system to locate a dancer in one of eight zones across the stage i did some experiments with pyroelectric detectors and found them difficult to align to get a definite zone transition and dancers stand still alot so their ir signature goes away the good thing about pryoelectrics is that their signal is proportional to the size of the warm body or body part and the velocity of said body this could be useful for detecting the intensity of a dance gesture dancers also really hate to wear little boxes and batteries strapped on their bodies but they really need to be emitting some kind of signal to be tracked
1 | yes it does all the equipment has to have that telekom approval number to be legal what has changed is that you can buy the equipment somewhere else i m pretty sure the same holds true in sweden at least when i read some information on it about tweo years ago and btw i do know that most of the lines in sweden can handle tone dialing just don t be sure that all can
1 | this is called silver bearing solder it is used to solder to devices that have silvered contacts one application is soldering to the ceramic terminal strips used in the old tektronix scopes these were notched ceramic strips that were silver plated in the notches if you used ordinary solder the molten metal would disolve the silver off of the ceramic the silver was quite thin the 2 is a saturated solution of silver in tin and lead thus no more silver can be disolved in the solder solution other devices that use silver contacts are quartz crystals and ultrasonic transducers

1 | for some time i ve been thinking about the possiblity of starting a group where scientific articles can be published or perhaps just summaries possible advantages would be free disribution fast acceptance online discussion between authers and readers this would be possible with one group with a moderator for publishing the articles and one perhaps without for discussion the best thing would be if all the articles would be in a standard format which would make it possible to print or view the documents camera ready perhaps postscript or rich text format but how do you start a new group anyone interrested

1 | acetone will likely damage the carpet first solvent to try is denatured alcohol do not waste your time with rubbing alcohol you can use methyl alcohol instead of denatured alcohol if you want to have a cocktail while you are removing the goo use pure grain alcohol if the alcohol does not work try carbon tetrachloride if neither of these work you may need to try a stronger solvent but the alcohol works for most adhesives good luck
1 | in article 735604750 28979 0 unix5 andrew cmu edu mark yeck hey can someone clue me in on these and other weird types of amplifiers just a brief intro to the concepts behind these would be cool i have the clues on type a b and ab already and stuff but these other ones are mentioned occasionally and i dont know what they do i think type d is like a pwm scheme or something thanx in advanced the whole point to these weird amplifier types is improved efficiency class d amps are pwm pulse width modulation amps which work very much like switching power supplies i think i ve seen these things called class s before as well they re capable of very high efficiencies and would be suitable for very high power i ve yet to see anything like this used in an audiophile amp though i ve been trying to design a three kilowatter for the last year to be used as an inverter for an ups but have been having serious problems with layout parasitics 10 irf 450 s in parallel any help with a do able isolated drive ckt would be appreciated i m not absolutely positive about this but i beleive a class g amp is one that operates off a variable or switched power supply rail voltage the carver amps do something like this they use some sort of phase control circuit i do not fully understand its operation to reduce the transformer size and i beleive that is patented i had an m400 apart trying to fix and found that it had three rail voltages that it switched between i ran a simulation on pspice and found that the topology would greatly reduce power dissipation heat under large signal conditions or when driving reactive loads which draw high current at the zero voltage crossings

2 | last year i was totally surprised when my annual physical disclosed an inguinal hernia i couldn t remember doing anything that would have caused it that is i hadn t been lifting more than other people do and in fact probably somewhat less eventually the thing became more painful and i had the repair operation this year i developed a pain on the other side this turned out to be another inguinal hernia so i go back to the hospital monday for another fun 8 operation i don t know of anything i m doing to cause this to happen i m 38 years old and i don t think i m old enough for things to start falling apart like this the surgeon who is doing the operation seems to suspect a congenital weakness but if so why did it suddenly appear when i was 37 and not really as active as i was when i was younger does anyone know how to prevent a hernia other than not lifting anything it s rare that i lift more than my 16 month old or a sack full of groceries and you may have noticed that your typical grocery sack is fairly small these days is there some sort of exercise that will reduce the risk of course my wife thinks it s from sitting for long periods of time at the computer reading news

1 | nope your problem is either being caused by excessive voltage drop in the long cable from the generator or just plain not having enough power i would suspect that those amps are going to draw a lot of current on short peaks you can try using larger and shorter cables to the generator or try strapping the amps for 240v service and running 240v mains cables out which will minimize the line drop if these don t work though you re going to need a bigger generator i assume that you re using well maintained generators and have watched the voltage output on the generator properly if you don t have 120v coming out of the unloaded generator you ll never get 120v at the other end
2 | when i was a school boy my biology teacher told us of an incident in which a couple were very passionate without actually having sexual intercourse somehow the girl became pregnent as sperm cells made their way to her through the clothes via persperation was my biology teacher misinforming us or do such incidents actually occur sounds to me like someone was pulling your leg there is only one way for pregnancy to occur intercourse these days however there is also artificial insemination and implantation techniques but we re speaking of natural acts here it is possible for pregnancy to occur if semen is deposited just outside of the vagina i e coitus interruptus but that s about at far as you can get through clothes no way better go talk to your biology teacher

3 | according to this reasoning there are no rights at least none that i can think of let s see do i have a right to unpolluted air no because the majority drive cars and use goods that create air pollution in the manufacturing process do i have the right to clean water i guess not by the same reasoning i could go on with these examples for a long time look at nazi germany because of the majority jews homosexuals blacks and others that were different had no rights in fact they were terrorized imprisoned and slaughtered in this country did blacks have the right to be free from slavery i guess not because the majority said that slavery was good for them i think that a right has a moral imperative if a law imposed by the majority is immoral one should not follow it in fact one should do everything in his her power to stop it of course that doesn t mean that i would lose all common sense to break the law just because i thought it was immoral i pay my federal income tax even though i am morally opposed to the u s government taking my money and spending it on weapons of mass destruction and terrorism this is precisely the point i am trying to make we should _persude_ people by logic pointing out that it is in their self interest to let all have equal rights in all aspects of life including adequate housing food and medical care i just happen to think that for a full life the aesthetic of beauty and joy is also necessary that is why i consider an uncluttered night sky a right have you ever been out in the desert away from local lights and most people the sky is dark and transparent the milky way is ablaze with more detail than you thought possible the beauty and wonder takes your breath away now imagine you live in the worst ghetto say in l a due to light pollution you have never seen a dark sky you might in fact never not in your whole life ever see the majesty of the night sky every where around you you see squalor and through your life runs a thread of dispair what is there to live for i admit these two scenarios are extreme examples but i have seen both i for one need dreams and hopes and yes beauty as a reason for living that is why i consider an uncluttered night sky a right george

2 | i am writing this to find out the following 1 any information on surgery to prevent reflux esophagitis 2 the name s of a doctor s who specialize in such surgery 3 information on reflux esophagitis which leads to cancer my boyfriend age 34 and otherwise in good health was diagnosed with reflux esophagitis and a hiatal hernia about 2 years ago at that time he saw a gastroenterologist and has tried acid controllers mylanta tagamet as well as a restricted diet and raising the head of his bed these treatments were not effective and because the damage was worsening he opted for a surgical repair 3 months ago he was told there were two repair techniques that could fix the problem a nissen wrap and a hill repair he opted for the hill repair he recovered very well from the surgery itself but the pain he had originally is worse and in addition he now has trouble swallowing including saliva the doctor now wants to do an endoscopy and has also informed him that a biopsy might be necessary if he has a pre cancerous condition which he called barrett s syndrome if he can t avoid having reflux will he necessarily get cancer basically if anyone has any information on what he should do now i d appreciate it thanks

2 | robert i m so glad that you posted your biological alchemy discussion i ve been compared to the famous robert mcelwaine by some readers of sci med i didn t know how to respond since i had not seen one of your posts just like i haven t read the yeast connection let me just start by stating that the authors of the cold fusion papers of recent years are now in scientific exile i believe that one has actually left the country scientific fraud is rare i m still not sure that if a review of the research notes of the cold fusion scientists actually proved fraud or just very shoddy experimentation your sources do not seem to be research articles they are more like lay texts designed to pique human interest in a subject area just like the food combining and life extension texts robert i try to keep an open mind but some things i just can t buy one is taking sod orally to prevent oxidative damage in the body your experiment if conducted by readers of this news group would prove that you are right more ash after seed sprouting than before unless you use a muffle furnance and obtain a very high temperature above 600 degrees i believe you will get organic residue in the ash even the residue in commercial incinerators contains organic residue i remember doing this kind of experiment in my organic chemistry couurse in college but i couldn t find a temperature for mineral ash formation so i m really guessing at 600 degrees f it may actually be much higher the point is that no one in their home could ever get a high enough temperature to produce only a mineral ash they also could not measure the minerals so they could only weigh the ash and find out that you appear to be correct chemical reactions abound in our body in our atmosphere in our water and in our soil are these fusion reactions yes many of them do involve fusing oxygen nitrogen and sulfur to both organics and inorganics do we really have the transformation of silicone to calcium if carbon is fused with silicon not in my book robert silicon is the most abundant mineral on our planet i ve seen speculation that man could have evolved to be a silicon based rather than a carbon based life form i like reading science fiction as many people do but i know enough about biochemistry and nutrition to be able in most cases to separate the fiction from the fact silicon may be one of the trace elements that turns out to be essential in humans we have several grams of the stuff in our body what s it doing there only the lord knows right now but i will tell you what i do know about silicon and why as you state it helps bone healing and it is not because silicon is transformed into calcium almost all of the silicon in the human body is found in the connective tissue collagen and elastin there have been studies published which show that the very high silicon content in elastin may be an important protective factor against atherosclerosis the higher the silicon content in elastin the more resistant the elastin is to a an age related loss of elasticity which may play a role in the increase in blood pressure that is often seen as part of the ageing process in humans for bone fracture healing the first step is a collagen matrix into which calcium and phosphate are pumped by osteoblasts a high level of silicon in the diet seems to speed up this matrix formation this first step in the bone healing process seems to be the hardest for some people to get going electriacl currents have been used in an attempt to get the matrix forming cells oriented in the right direction so that the matrix can be formed in the gap or gaps between the ends of the broken bone a vitamin c deficiency by slowing collagen formation as well as causing the prodcution of defective collagen does slow down both bone and wound healing zinc is also another big player in bone and wound healing and so is silicon in an undetermined role that most likely involes matrix formation and not transformation of silicon to calcium for you to take this bone healing observation and use it as proof that silicon is transformed into calcium is an interesting little trick but robert i have the same problem myself when i read the lay press and yes even some scientific papers is the explanation reasonable without a very good science knowledge base you and most readers of this news group are flying blind you have to take it on faith because you don t know any better if the explanation seems to make sense to me based on my knowledge base i m inclined to consider it this usually means trying to find other sources that come to the same conclusion if the idea like a candida bloom seems to make sense to me i tend to pursue it as long as any advice that i m going to give isn t going to really mess somebody up if this makes us kindred souls robert then i guess i ll have to live with that label for the physicians who have decided to read my response to robert s interesting post i hope that you saw the segment on the pediatric neurosurgeon last night on u s tv i can t remember the network or his name like many nights i was on my computer and my wife was watching tv in our den where i have my computer setup this neurosurgeon takes kids with brain tumors that everyone else has given up on and he uses unconventional treatments his own words he says that he has a 70 success rate the one case that i heard him discussing would normally use radiation conventional treatment he was going to go in and cut you guys complain about the cost of the anti fungals what do you think the cost difference between radiation treatment and surgery is guys i m going to ask you guys one more time why blast a physician who takes the chronic sinus sufferer like jon and the chronic gi sufferer like elaine and tries to help them using unconventional treatments treatments which do not result in death like those that the neurosurgeon uses is it because candida blooms are not life threatening while brain tumors are how about quality of life guys may the candida demon never cross your sinus cavity or gut if it does you may feel differently about the issue

1 | back in high school i used to work for a detailing company and one of the services we offered was an engine cleaning remove all that oil before you sell the car unfortunately we did not have a high pressure washer so we would use one several miles from the shop on more than one occasion after washing the engine it would not start as water would have gotten under the distributor i would put a plastic bag around it to try and minimize this around the spark plug wires etc and it would be nearly impossible to try and wipe all these areas down with a dry rag the usual solution was to carry a can of wd 40 and when the car wouldn t start to spray all the likely areas and it would then start on the very first time it may be a myth but it certainly kept me from being stranded at a car wash

2 | with counterflame enabled columbus was indeed a crank but not in the manner you think the fact that the world was round was well known when he set sail it was also well known that the circumference was about 25k miles and that you could not reach asia bo going west with current technology you would neither be able to carry enough supplies nor get a long enough stretch of good sailing weather nobody thought he would fall off the edge of the world instead they expected him to die at sea columbus thought for no good reason that the circumference was only 16k miles making the trip practical unfortunately for columbus and his shipmates the earth s circumference is indeed 25k miles fortunately for columbus and his shipmates there was a stopping place right about where asia would have been had the circumference been 16k miles my source is the recent pbs series on columbus

3 | this reminds me my fuzzy brain recalls that somebody was thinking of reviving the san marco launch platform off the coast of kenya where the copernicus satellite was launched around 1972 is this true or am i imagining it possibly it s connected with one of the italian programs to revive the scout in a new version that old platform must be getting pretty rusty and there ain t a lot of infrastructure to go with it
3 | well no during the original deployment mission the hst aperture door was not opened until after the shuttle had landed i presume that during a re boost mission hst would be berthed in the orbiter with the orbiter bay doors shut but still there would be lots of contamination worries i understand that the eva suits are one of the hardest things to keep clean but i still don t know where the idea is coming from that hst _needs_ a re boost we have many problems but our orbit is the least of them there is certainly no plan to change the orbit in the first servicing mission in december

2 | which was why i started checking every time i got sick and every time i got sick msg was somehow involved in one of the food products which points up the studies made by amateurs did you also check every time you did not get sick no you say why not check every thing you eat when you don t get sick and find out how much msg you re actually consuming all that s needed now is that final step a double blind study done on humans there isn t even an ethical question about possible harm as this is a widely used and approved food additive but some say that only 2 of the population has a problem with msg some say it s more like 20 but let s say that it s 5 how many people would have to be tested that would have a problem also i know i have a problem with it and i wouldn t volunteer for a test if you knew enough about what the test was about to decide that you didn t want to participate because it involved msg you d ve already made yourself ineligible since msg is detectable by taste how can anybody be so clueless as to what double blind studies are all about carl j lydick internet carl sol1 gps caltech edu nsi hepnet sol1 carl

3 | sure about that maybe proxima might cause problems but at oort cloud distances ac a and ac b together look like a point source besides even the solar system s oort cloud is unstable over geologic time right and needs to be replentished from somewhere else like the short period comets of the kupier belt or maybe i m misremembering something i read or heard somewhere until we re able to perform a broad band survey of nearby stars to detect planets we won t know enough to say whether or not a single star has planets and we re likely to find out about the close ones first heck if neutron stars can have planets anything can have planets or was that discovery disconfirmed
3 | this is one of those yes but things it s true that a hydraulically pressurized tube can be somewhat more rigid than an unpressurized tube but even at 2000 psi levels a hydraulic hose will bend rather easily though it s straight on compressive strength is high and it s torsional resistance increase is practically nil on the other grasping member there s no doubt that hydraulic leverage exists in nature tree roots are an example given time they can shatter concrete as osmotic pressure increases kangaroos 3 limbed i don t think so if you take the view that the tail is a limb then monkeys and kangaroos are 5 limbed i think the tail is a different kind of structure grossly enlarged in the case of the kangaroo but primarily still an instrument of balance rather than locomotion i don t know much about panda thumbs so i ll ask is it opposable well i won t say flat out that they can t be intelligent but i ll bring a couple of lines of argument to bear to try to show why i don t think it s likely first let me say that when i say intelligent i mean complex behaviors in response to novel situations on a level with or greater than human tool use and tool building ie assuming suitable manipulators are present on the creature to allow it to alter it s enviroment in a planned way it will do so that s certainly not a universal or complete definition of intelligence but it will suffice for a putative technological alien now no one knows exactly what makes a brain capable of thought but it s generally accepted that one of the criteria is a certain level of complexity this is generally determined by the number of neuron cells and their interconnections so a creature the size of a lemur wouldn t have enough neurons to support complex thought this argument is considerably less clear in the case of the dinosaur there s room for a large brain though no indication that one ever developed one reason this may be true is neuronic speed the electrochemical messages that trigger neurons require time to propagate this makes it difficult for a highly complex central brain to coordinate the movements of very large creatures so there s little selection pressure for such brains instead a simpler distributed network evolves this doesn t rule out intelligent dinosaurs but it points in that direction then there are the thermodynamic arguments a tiny creature like the lemur needs to eat frequently because it s internal heat is rapidly lost due to it s high surface to volume ratio i contend that a creature that must spend most of it s time and energy feeding won t have the time to develop and exercise intelligence that argument may be somewhat weak the dinosaur s problem is the reverse it must moderate it s heat production because it s high volume to surface ratio makes it tend to retain waste heat i m assuming that a certain temperature range is optimal for chemical reactivity reasons for productive neuron function so creatures would tend to need to maintain a regulated temperature in a range near that of humans if they are carbon based that tends to rule out cold blooded creatures as potential homes of intelligence some people contend that some of the dinosaurs may have been warm blooded but for a creature the size of a brontosaur it s activity levels would have to be restrained or it would be prone to generate an internal steam explosion from the waste heat whales are similar size but they can reject heat to the ocean a much more efficient sink than air i suspect that for intelligence to manifest itself a certain degree of activity in interacting with the environment is necessary ie monkey curiousity i doubt a large dinosaur would be capable of that much activity gary

2 | i m a fellow applicant and my situation is not too much better i applied to about 20 schools got two interviews got one offer and am waiting to hear from the other school let me be honest about my experiences and impressions about the medical school admissions process numbers gpa mcats are not everything but they are probably more important than anything else in fact some schools screen out applicants based on these numbers and never even look at your other qualities of course when this happens don t expect a refund on your 50 application fee but the fact that you got four interviews tells me that you have the numbers and are very well qualified academically you mentioned one response was it an acceptance denial or wait list if i assume the worst that it was a denial then you still have a great probability of acceptance somewhere how did your interviews go as for how long you have to wait i ve called a few schools who never contacted me for anything many of them told me that the interview season for them was over and that if i haven t heard by now i can assume a denial many rejection letters are not sent out until may or as late as june but some schools are still interviewing i really don t think you should worry don t become fixated on the mailbox go out have fun be very proud of yourself what do people think of the medical school admissions process i had a very mediocre gpa but high mcat scores and i have been working as a software engineer for two years i majored in computer science at stanford still i think the profile of the person who has the best chance of getting admitted is something like this very important gpa 3 5 or better mcat top 15 in all subject medium importance writing speaking ability maturity motivation for going into medicine activities less important college or university major work experience anything else you want them to know anyway you are in good shape i think admissions committees are bound in many ways by the numbers but would like very much to understand each person as an individual sometimes thats just not practical but getting four interviews is an indicator that you have the numbers hopefully you were able to impress them with your character

3 | this definitely had nothing to do with the entry of the government into the support of science some of it is relevant in technology there was little involvement of federal funds or except through support of state universities of state funds for scientific research before wwii the us research position had been growing steadily and the funding was mainly from university and private foundation funds there were not that many research universities but they all provided their researchers with low teaching loads laboratories assistants and equipment and funds for travel to scientific meetings not that much but it was provided and a university wishing to get a scholar had to consider research funding as well as salary during wwii the military and the defense departments found that pure scientists could do quite well with their problems even though they were not exactly in the areas of the scientists expertise this is probably because of the research mind approach which is not to try to find a solution but to understand the problem and see if a solution emerges this works in stages and as research scientists were used to discussion about their problems the job got done the military realized the importance of maintaining scientists for the future and started funding pure research after wwii but congress was unwilling to have military funds diverted into this investment into the future supply of scientists and set up other organizations such as nsf to do the job it also set up an elaborate procedure to supposedly keep politics out also the government did a job on private foundations making it more difficult for them to act to support research the worst part of the federal involvement is that in those areas in which the government supports research the university will not provide funding and in fact expects its scholars to bring in net government money suppose as has been the case i have a project which could use the assistance of a graduate student for a few months what do you think happens if i ask for one the answer i will get is get the money from nsf now the money at the university level is a few thousand but at the nsf level it comes to about 20 thousand and is likely to keep a faculty member from getting supported so the government is in effect deciding which projects get supported and how much also the government decided that the wealth should be spread so instead of having a moderate number of universities which were primarily research institutions the idea that more schools should get into the act came into being and instead of evaluating scholars they had to go to evaluating reseach proposals as a researcher i can tell you that any research proposal has to be mainly wishful thinking or as now happens the investigator conceals already done work to release it as the results of the research what i am proposing today i may solve before the funding is granted i may find impossible or i may find that it is too difficult in addition tomorrow i may get unexpected research results possibly i may bet a bright idea which solves yesterday s too difficult problem or a whole new approach to something i had not considered can develop this is the nature of the beast and except for really vague statements if something can be predicted it is not major research but development or routine activity not requiring more than minimal attention of a good researcher i believe that at this time less quality research is being done than would have happened if the government had never gotten into it and the government is trying to divert researchers from thinkers to plodders

1 | sorry about following up my own article but i wanted to continue that what might be being missed here is that the important thing might not be temperature differences per se but the action of heat sinking the battery perhap someone could conduct an experiment taking two identical lead acid batteries placing both on wooden shelves but putting one of them in a water bath designed to act as a heat sink this would eliminate the concrete floor effect and keep both batteries at the same ambient temperature i think the argument over temperatures is not pertinent but the one over heat conductance and removing the exothermic heat may have some validity

3 | obviously not count rates are too low and signal rise times too long for this to be possible the cgro is what 10 meters long you d need to time to an accuracy of nanoseconds to do this what batse actually does is measure the relative strength in each of the detectors also as a function of photon energy each of the detectors does not have isotropic response to do this right one must model the scattering of photons in the material around each detector and even scattering of photons off the earth s atmosphere back onto the spacecraft i believe they have now reduced the error to about 2 degrees

resurgence of infectious diseases blamed on newly emerging viruses and bacteria pose a major challenge for the nation s health care system federal health officials said thursday the centers for disease control and prevention reporting its latest findings in an investigation of contaminated hamburger meat that sickened hundreds in 4 states and killed at least four said it will put renewed emphasis on battling infectious diseases part of that emphasis includes a new series titled emerging infectious diseases to be featured in the cdc s morbidity mortality weekly report which has a wide circulation in the health community the issue also will top the agenda of a two day meeting of scientific counselors to update the cdc s draft plan for dealing with the growing threat of infectious ailments this is an issue that has been coming and we do have a responsibility to deal with it said dr ruth berkelman deputy director of the cdc s national center for infectious diseases there were more cases of malaria in the u s in 1992 than in any year since the 1960s and latin america is experiencing a cholera epidemic the first in this century she said resistance of disease causing agents to antibiotics is also a problem we are seeing much more antibiotic resistance than we have in the past berkleman said she said even common ear infections frequently seen in children are becoming resistant to antibiotic treatment despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states the cdc said it cited the emergence since the 1970s of a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes such as escherichia coli o157 h7 a deadly bacterial infection the hepatitis c virus hiv the virus that causes aids legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis have increased in many areas the cdc said it said efforts at control and prevention have been undermined by drug resistance source wall street journal reference 04 15 93 pb1 headline lyme disease ruling raises liability issues the tick that causes lyme disease may have found a new way to cause damage legal liability a federal judge s decision holding a property owner liable for not doing enough to protect workers from lyme disease is getting as much attention as the latest medical study on the disease a flu like illness that can cause severe physical and mental disabilities and in rare instances death the decision last week has put property owners on notice that they may have to do more than protect themselves from the ticks they also may have to protect themselves from litigation if someone becomes infected while on the property the decision by u s district judge robert j ward in new york came after a week long trial in a case involving four track workers for the long island railroad judge ward found that the workers contracted the disease after they were bitten by ticks while on the job he ordered the new york state owned commuter line to pay the workers more than 560 000 to compensate for pain and suffering in addition to medical expenses and lost wages summer camps schools companies with facilities in rural or semirural areas and homeowners who rent to vacationers are among the groups that need to be worried about this ruling says stephen l kass an attorney at new york law firm berle kass case who wrote a legal article three years ago warning property owners of the potential liability even a family that invites friends over for a backyard barbecue might be potentially liable lawsuits for insect bites while rare aren t unheard of a summer vacationer in southampton n y last year sued the owner of the home she rented claiming that a tick on the property gave her rocky mountain spotted fever in 1988 also on long island a jury ordered an outdoor restaurant to pay more than 3 million to a patron who was stung by a bee causing an allergic reaction and permanent quadriplegia the judge later threw out the award citing no evidence that a beehive was near the restaurant but lawyers say that the attention to lyme disease throughout the country it s most prevalent in new england the middle atlantic states wisconsin minnesota and the northwest may make this particular insect bite a particularly litigious one the illness already has proved to be a source of controversy in the courtroom over such issues as the type of medical care insurers will cover and medical malpractice claims against doctors for not diagnosing the disease lawyers say worker s compensation claims related to lyme disease have become common in some states in recent years payments in worker s compensation cases however are limited to medical costs and lost earnings the case before judge ward dealt with a potentially much more lucrative avenue for damages because it involved the question of negligence unlike the worker s compensation process the law governing injuries to rail workers allows for a finding of negligence and as a result for additional payments for pain and suffering property owners and lawyers say that negligence claims can be made in many other situations where people are exposed to the ticks that carry the disease ira m maurer a partner at new york law firm elkind flynn maurer who represented the rail workers says the decision will help to establish the duty of all sorts of property owners to protect against lyme disease lawyers caution that despite judge ward s decision winning a lawsuit for damages caused by lyme disease may prove difficult for one thing victims have to demonstrate that they have pinned down when and where they got the tick bite judge ward found that the plaintiffs in the railroad case got lyme disease while working on property owned by the railroad even though none of the men remembered being bitten the workers who weren t outdoorsmen likely to be exposed elsewhere to the insects said they saw ticks in the high grass that surrounded some work sites a spokeswoman for the railroad says that there was no proof that the four men were bitten while on the job and that the railroad is considering an appeal the railroad also disputes judge ward s finding that it didn t do enough to protect employees the spokeswoman says the railroad provides track workers with insect repellent and special pants to protect against bug bites debate in the scientific community over lyme disease could open up some legal defenses for property owners such as questioning whether a victim actually has the disease rather than some other illness earlier this week the journal of the american medical association reported that doctors overly diagnose patients as having lyme disease and damages awarded to a victim also might be influenced by medical disputes over the degree of harm that lyme disease causes because of health and safety concerns some groups and companies already take special measures to protect against lyme disease last year at its headquarters in franklin lakes n j becton dickinson co began using damminix a pesticide made by ecohealth inc of boston that is designed to kill ticks carrying the disease the medical supply company s headquarters include a 120 acre park and the company was worried that employees who walk on its trails for recreation might get infected ruth lister a spokeswoman for the american camping association in indianapolis says that many youth camps accredited by her organization also have begun to check children for ticks and carole katz a member of the board of the fire island pines property owners association says her group spends 30 000 each year to treat their 100 acre site off the coast of new york with the tick killing pesticide title urinary

2 | you ve asked a toughie of a question there are many different drugs which are used for chemotherapy the overall purpose of chemotherapy don t worry about the spelling some of these crazy medical words are impossible to spell is to either destroy cancer cells or to keep them from growing different drugs have different effects on cancer cells and therefore it is not uncommon to use more than one drug at a time some chemotherapeutic drugs are effective anytime during the growth cycle of a cell others work only at specific times during the cell cycle the first phase of the cell cycle is g1 it is when the protein synthesis and rna systhesis occurs in the second phase s synthesis of dna occurs the third phase is g2 the dna splits and rna and protein are synthesized aagain in the fourth phase m or mitosis the cell may divide there are drugs which are effective in each phase some stop dna synthesis others stop the cell from dividing others wreck protein synthesis at any rate the end result that is being sought is for the cancer cells to stop growing if what you are seeking is practical advice i apologize for rambling on the techno stuff some side effects are pretty common chemo drugs are rather nasty it can cause a person to lose their appetite and to experience nausea and vomiting things to help this include eating small frequent meals it is also suggested that if nausea vomiting hereafter known as n v occurs that the person notify the doctor there are medicines tthat help nausea diarrhea can be an effect antidiarrheal medications can be given and good skincare and fluid intake are important probably the one of biggest concsern is hair loss this does not always happen it depends on what drugs are being given and on the person themself different people taking the same drug can and do have different side effects i have seen some literature which states that wearing a snug headband and or wearing an ice cap can help reduce hair loss presumably by reducing blood flow to the scalp if anyone has seen research on this too i would love to see it and possibly some bib data i highly recommend making contact with the american cancer society they have a vast selection of literature and information in addition if your friend has had a mastectomy i highly recommend reach for recovery it is a support group comprised entirely of women who have lost a breast because of cancer they can offer some excellent support and suggestions if you have further questions please send me e mail i hav some good access to information and i enjoy trying to help other people

1 | sure the way is on different okay so what do you do if some part of the machine presumably the part on which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself upon goes bad you replace that part and now your program won t run because it s on a different computer this is of course assuming that the program uses something in rom like the bios serial number maybe and not a disk based code number obviously if the drive goes bad you ll be reinstalling the stuff anyway i work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system we have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred machines both pc and macintosh as well as administering a network of over 50 next machines i personally am concerned only with a small lab with ten pc s and ten mac s i m not the manager but help him with admin often imho copy protection schemes of any sort are nothing more than a major headache for the legitimate user anyone who wants a copy of your program and doesn t care about legality will get a copy period pirate board or no pirate board i too have friends who blatantly and quite successfuly hack copy protection schemes practically in their sleep let s consider what goes on in our lab almost daily we have at least one machine down sometimes several due to some goofball screwing up some setting or other on a piece of software admittedly we being students mostly are not the world s most efficient and effective network administrators but we try keeping even the twenty machines that are partly my responsibility even vaguely looking and acting similar to the average user and maintaining behind the scenes consistency is a real headache but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty different folder locations of norton utilities when some guy trashes his disk often we have hardware problems at peak business times and have to do some parts swapping to get stuff working temporarily well i ll cut to the chase and quit boring y all the point is often we have to re install software and copy configuration files etc from machine to machine by far the easiest way we have found to do this is to get one machine working exactly the way we want to then copy the complete setup of this machine to the other nine of that machine s type this ensures us that for at least ten minutes we have ten identical machines to work with having them networked simplifies this considerably as our major packages wordperfect windows etc are all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with often however we need to install a package requested by some instructor to one some or all of the machines for a special project this is usually a hand written or shareware etc program similar to what i believe the original poster was asking about the few we have had with copy protection schemes have caused nothing but nightmares for us to maintain in short don t waste your time with a copy protection scheme it s sort of like outlawing guns the criminals will get your program anyway and you will only be hurting the legitimate honest user write a good user s guide and tech manual whatever else for your program please do this regardless of whether you copy protect the thing and only distribute the manual to licensed users jack the price to cut your losses but please take a cue from the major companies who can admittedly afford the costs of illegal copies far better than you and don t burden the legitimate user with a copy protection scheme sorry for the tirade but it s been a long day here mark s underwood ee student university of kentucky lab assistant boyd hall microlab a tiny little division of uk library microlabs e mail msunde01 mik uky edu

1 | uh bob why is the battery warmer than ground temperature on the time scales in question and with the considerably reduced temperature swings several feet underground there isn t going to be any major temperature difference between the battery and what it s sitting on because the temperature of your hand unlike that of the battery is determined by the balance between internal heat production and external heat loss you re feeling the greater rate of heat loss from an object your hand which is kept much warmer than its surroundings in the case of an object with no significant internal heat production this will affect how quickly it comes into equilibrium with its surroundings if it started out not in equilibrium with them but won t affect the final temperature for the same reason windchill affects whether you will freeze but not whether water will freeze

3 | i would appreciate any thoughts on what makes a planet habitable for humans i am making asumptions that life and a similar atmosphere evolve given a range of physical aspects of the planet the question is what physical aspects simply disallow earth like conditions eg temperature range of 280k to 315k where temp is purely dependant on dist from the sun and the suns temperature atmospheric presure i know nothing of human tolerance planetary mass again gravity at surface is important how much can human bodies take day after day also how does the mass effect atmosphere i thinking of planets between 3 and 3 times mass of the earth i suppose density should be important as well climate etc does not concern me nor does axial tilt etc etc just the above three factors and how they relate to one another jonathan

1 | just thought i would add 0 02 to deskjet thread i got my first one in college about 5 or so years ago i ve been a happy hp user of the deskwriter for macintosh for past 5 years i got one just a few months after their release and i got software revision 1 0a now i m up to rev 3 1 our family sister and father have each purchased their own dw s after seeing mine go for one year unscathed their stuck to their trusty imagewriter ii s the original dw has gone for 5 years at moderate personal use i would say that it has gone through at least 15 000 sheets and around one small ink cartridge every 3 months or so my brother might take this dw now i m probably gonna give it to him and i am looking to upgrade to a color dw the chief advantages disadvantages i ve found over the years are advantages quick 2 3 ppm quiet roomate can sleep while it s printing appletalk networkable unfortunately the original wasn t so look out if you buy used i rewired our home with phonenet appletalk connectors and while home we can all use my dad s one dw and cheap now run 300 btw you can upgrade older dw s to color or for appletalk i dunno if hp still does the upgrades but i received many offers i just didn t ned it however also crisp laser quality output is a wonder used to really impress those imagewriter dot matrix people so much so that i had to charge 0 25 per sheet to stop my college dorm neighbors from bothering me at all hours of the night disadvantages ink used to be hard to find and wasn t cheap and wasn t originally water proof while hp has done wonders with the ink i dunno if it s still toxic it is still subjet to smearing and running if you run around in the damp boston rain and get your bookbag completely soaked ink now runs about 14 15 for small carts i get mine from elek tek in chicago i think they re now down to 12 the ink carts used to say they re dated for only 6 months but i don t think they say so anymore we stick to a 4 month supply of about 3 carts we use cheap hammerhill laser print paper after fooling for a long time laser xerox paper is also good smearing doesn t happen unless you have a brand new ink cart and you grab the paper and smudge it all over as soon as it comes out of the machine other disadvantages are no postscript this can be an advantage in speed usually ways around this are ghostscript or freedom of press software solutions i bet hp probably has a ps prototype inkjet but they won t release it for fear of hurting lj sales in the end the primary advantages of laser are true postscript unless you go for cheap lasers and fused toner no smearing even when soaking in water lasers are slightly sharper but the only instance where i needed precise layouts was printed circuit board transparencies for photoetching i found a textronix color phaser postscript thermal wax transfer to work the best to make pcb negatives directly onto a transparency
3 | re response from cob of boeing on ssto boeing has been looking at several tsto vehicles and has carried out extensive conceptual studies of advanced launch systems for some time a good reference on this might be comparison of propulsion options for advanced earth to orbit eto applications iaf 92 0639 by v a weldon and l e fink from boeing the paper describes a propane fueled tsto launch system claimed to achieve aircraft like operational efficiencies without the problems associated with liquid hydrogen fuel basically it s a high speed airplane launching a hermes type spaceplane the design the concept is also called beta as laid out in the paper can launch at least 10 000 pounds into polar orbit or 20 000 pounds to space station orbit including a crew of eight persons and life support system design reliability is 9995 beta is a 360 foot long first stage powered by two large ramjets and 12 high speed civil transport hsct turbofans a 108 foot long reusable orbiter is trapeze mounted in the belly of the first stage aircraft which also could accommodate a longer and heavy payload on an expendable second stage to launch the orbital vehicle the first stage takes off like a normal hsct and accelerates to mach 3 at that point the turbofans modified to burn catalyzed jp 7 would shut off and the ramjets would take over at mach 5 5 the orbiter or the elv would swing out ignite and proceed to orbit both vehicles would land like aircraft at the conclusion of their respective missions estimated total weight of the combined configuration at takeoff is about 1 5 m lbs roughly equivalanet to a fully loaded an 225 the orbiter stages weighs about 400 klbs including 335 klbs of lox and subcooled propane to power two 250 klbs vacuum thrust rocket engines propellants would be stored at 91 degrees kelvin with the propane in a spherical tank mounted forward of the 15 by 25 foot cargo bay and the two seat orbiter crew station lox would be stored aft weldon and fink claim the key to this design s success is the structurally efficient airframe and the compact tankage allowed by the high density supercooled hydrocarbon fuel the paper compares tsto design to ssto design they conclude while a ssto has a slightly lower recurring cost a tsto is easier cheaper and less risky to develop simpler to build has greater safety and mission versatility and doesn t carry the hard to handle and bulky hydrogen fuel the conlcude in conjunction with its major use of airplane type engines and fuel as well as its inherent self ferry capability it is probably the system most likely to provide as close to airline like operations as possible with a practical configuration until a single stage airbreather rocket concept can be shown to be operationally viable weldon and others at boeing have been working on tsto designs for some time i expect this or a similar concept perhaps the hthl ssto they proposed for the sdio ssto first phase is being re examined as a basis for a bid on the first phase of spacelifter does it threaten dc possibly there is a set of on going studies trying straighten out the government s future space transportation strategy mdc and boeing as well as other firms are providing data to a joint study team back in dc there are various factions and options vying for attention including shuttle upgrades shuttle replacement what was called the 4 2 3 architecture spacelifter elv upgrades and various advanced vehicles ales beta dc nasp fsts sstos of several types etc nasa dod dot are trying to put together a coherent strategy for future us gov t space transportation systems and trying to juggle near term launch needs like for dod and nasa against medium term needs including commercial considerations and against the investment and risk of going to leap frog new technologies like sdio ssto and nasp and beta it s a heck of a problem the worst part of the problem isn t that there aren t promising ideas and concepts there are dozens of them but how they balance cost and risk versus real needs in the near term they should have a draft report in mid june with a final report coming by the end of the fiscal year wales larrison space technology investor

1 | bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operator s house and ask him for his opinion of what you re hearing most communities you cannot do that legally however you can ask a ham over to listen if the interference occurs at a specific time each day then it would be possible to do such scheduling if nothing else you could invite the ham over to transmit from your driveway to see if he interferes if he does then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to make it immune to rf interference as a coupld of people have pointed out this is wrong it is not illegal to record or disclose what you heard on the ham bands

2 | i agree with this consensus that it should not have been written the way it was my doctor who claims to have introduced dr crook to the possibility of candida overbloom causing diffuse symptoms way back in 1961 i have no reason to doubt him on this does not like the book because 1 it makes too many unfounded claims and 2 is horribly written from a scientific viewpoint on the other hand my doctor has always kept an open mind on the subject and does believe in aspects of the yeast connection but i believe there is some truth to the book hopefully the right clinical studies can be done to separate the fact from the fiction in the meantime i d still encourage people who have incurable chronic sinus problems especially if they overused antibiotics to find a doctor to administer a systemic type anti fungal such as itraconazole along with liver panels before during and after treatment just to play it safe it is an empirical approach for sure but when all else fails and your ent says sorry you ll just have to live with it it is time to step out and try an empirical approach backed up with significant anecdotal evidence dr ivker supported by plausible theories outlined by marty at this stage you have little to lose particularly if you use itraconazole and have the proper monitoring the health risk has been shown through extensive clinical studies both in europe and the u s to be very minimal with relatively healthy i e non aids patients i m glad i did this since i saw remarkable results after only one week on sporanox itraconazole of course your mileage may vary a lot everyone is different so it may not work for you talk to your doctor jon noring charter member infj club

3 | this is a good question there are major blind spots in our understanding of what makes the earth habitable for example why does the earth s atmosphere have the concentration of oxygen it does the naive answer is photosynthesis but this is clearly incomplete photosynthesis by itself can t make the atmosphere oxygenated as the oxygen produced is consumed when the plants decay or are eaten what is needed is photosynthesis plus some mechanism to sequester some fraction of the resulting reduced material on earth this mechanism is burial in seafloor sediments of organic matter mostly from oceanic sources however this burial requires continental sediments in the deep ocean the burial rate is so slow that most material is consumed before it can be sequestered this suggests that a planet without large oceans or a planet without continents undergoing weathering will have a hard time accumulating an oxygen atmosphere in particular an all ocean planet may have a hard time supporting an oxygen atmosphere there is also the problem of why the oxygen in the earth s atmosphere has been relatively stable over geological time for a period at least 2 orders of magnitude longer than the decay time of atmospheric o2 to weathering in the absence of replenishment no convincing feedback mechanism has been identified perhaps the reason is the weak anthropic principle if during the last 500 myr or so the oxygen level had dropped too low we wouldn t be here to be wondering about it

1 | hmmm a possibility for the software registration conondrum would be to have the distributor register the copy when the software was sold the clerk sticks it in the store pc and asks for the buyers id later if pirated versions showed up they could be tracked to the original purchaser in addition copies which were sent to distributors stores would have a vendor reg or serial in order to track in store piracy possible additional program security schemes would be 1 having monthly password changes which necessitate user call in and registration inconvenient 2 taking dire legal action on anyone caught expensive 3 encryption crc check self modifying code limited effectiveness 4 have an independent watchdog program in the installation setup config or memory manager etc which would check the main program s crc only as effective as above methods at best 5 have the above watchdog circulating as a virus which would trash cracked copies of the program and or the offenders hard drive risky and probably illegal certainly immoral my new ideas aren t terribly feasible to implement as presented but i thought if i threw them out people could think of variations that might be effective what is the problem with parallel port security keys i haven t used anything that had hardware key copy protection schemes so i don t know what the drawbacks are i know the companies that make them claim they re uncrackable but i ve seen cracks of autodesk 3d studio floating around i don t have one so don t ask and i had heard that it had parralel port keys

1 | wrong wrong completely wrong and a little misleading too white noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant bandwidth that is a 5 hz wide band at 20 hz will have precisely the same amount of energy as a 5 hz band at 20 khz pink noise is random noise whose energy density is constant for a constant precentage bandwidth thus a 5 wide band of noise at 20 hz whose bandwidth is 1 hz will contain the same energy as a 5 wide band at 20 khz whose bandwidth is 1000 hz wide white noise is often used with spectrum analyzers that have constant bandwidths pink noise is used with audio type real time analyzers whose bandwidths are centert frequency dependent often described as 1 3 octave or 1 2 octave or some such terminology white noise relative to pink noise has more energy at high frequencies at a rate equal to 3 db per octave pink noise relative to white noise has more energy at low frequencies at a rate equl to again 3 db octave

2 | while i don t have an answer for you i reckon blaise pascal is generally credited with inventing the syringe per se i don t know much about the needles however i do know of a southwest virginia country doctor who some thrity or more years ago invented patented used and sold a syringe hypodermic needle combination that retracted injected with the flip of a trigger then retracted giving a near painless injection the fellow was dr daniel gabriel and it was termed the gabriel somebody else syringe did you come across that one plastic disposable syringes came onto the market about that time and his product went by the wayside to my knowledge

3 | we don t disagree on this all i said was that a right is whatever you or somebody acting for you can enforce the bill of rights didn t come into effect until it was ratified by the states and indirectly the people from that point it defined legal rights common law rights are vague and situational that s why the people insisted on a bill of rights in the constitution spelling out exactly what they demanded from the government legitimate or illegitimate power is power that s why the federal government can force states to grant their citizens rights they don t wish to in a slugging match the feds win period and you re right this doesn t belong in sci space i ve said my peace no more frome me on rights at least not here
1 | i know of at least one ftp site from which you can download the cracks of about any commercial game in existence the names of the companies yes companies are also blatantly advertised with the crack codes according to them it is not illegal at least in the usa according to a statute or something to remove the copy protection from any program the only condition is that you may only use this code on legally owned software for your own convenience if there is any interest i will download the advertisement of one such company i will not give the name of this ftp site to anyone even if only to protect the companies which wrote the original games disclaimer i do not condone the use or cracking of any programs i believe it hurts the industry and individuals in the long run on the subject of copy protection most pirates don t give a damn about using software on which the name of the registered owner came up on starting the program they just don t have a conscience

2 | i ve seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and demented during hospital stays in the examples i ve seen drugs were definitely involved my own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the hospital he was fifty three at the time and he was on 21 separate medications the family protested but the doctors were adamant telling us that none of the drugs interact they even took the attitude that if he was disoriented they should put him on something else as well with the help of an md friend of the family we had all his medication discontinued he had a seizure that night and was put back on one drug two days later he was his old self again i guess there aren t many medical texts that address the subject of 21 way interactions i saw the same thing happen to my father and i can more or less validate your take on hospitals it seems to me that medical science understands precious little about taking care of the human machine drugs are given as a response to symptoms and i guess that makes sense since all the studies that validate the effectiveness of those drugs are based on a narrow assessment of the degree of particular symptoms but there seems to be very little appreciation for the well being of a person outside of the numbers that appear on a test i watched my dad wither away and lose huge amounts of body fat and muscles tissue while in the hospital there is something a little crazy about a system in which there is more attention paid to giving you every latest drug available than there is attention paid to whether you have had enough to eat to prevent loss of muscle tissue it is really really bizarre

3 | yesterday i went to the boeing shareholders meeting it was a bit shorter than i expected last year when the stock was first down they made a big presentation on the 777 and other programs this year it was much more bare bones in any case i wanted to ask a question that the board of directors would hear and so i got there early and figured that if i didn t get to the mike maybe they would read mine off of a card and so i wrote it down and handed it in after the meeting started mr shrontz said that he would only answer written questions in order to be fair to the people in the overflow room that only had monitors downstairs naturally i was crushed so when question and answer time came i was suprised to find my question being read and answered admittedly near the end of the ones that he took presumably getting there early and getting the question in early made all the difference so on to the substance the question was is boeing looking at anything beyond the high speed civil transport such as a commercial space launch system and if not how will boeing compete with the reusable single stage to orbit technology presently being developed by mcdonnell douglass well he read it without a hitch and without editing with impressed me then he answered it very quickly treating it as a two part question last part first this is to the best of my recollection what he said as far as single stage to orbit technology we think that we have a better answer in a two stage approach and we are talking to some of our customers about that as far as commercialization that is a long ways off the high speed civil transport is about as far out as our commercial planning goes at this point so this tells me that boeing still considers space to be a non commercial arena and for the most part this is true however it also tells me that they consider there to be enough money in building space launchers for them to persue work on their own now i do have a friend on the spacelifter program at boeing actually this is a mis nomer as there is no spacelifter contract for the work that this guy is doing however he is doing work in preparation of a proposal for space lifter contracts he won t tell me what he is doing but maybe this is where the tsto action is taking place at boeing at the very minimum the chairman of the board of boeing said that they have an approach in mind and they are trying to do something with it anybody know anything further is this really news does this threaten further work on dc

2 | its bogus see the sci skeptic faq i edit it you can diagnose some things by looking at the eyes glaucoma is the classic example but there are probably others iridology maps parts of the body onto the irises of the eyes by looking at the patterns striations and occasional blobs in the irises you are supposed to be able to diagnose illnesses all over the body the two questions to ask any alternative therapist are 1 how does it work 2 what evidence is there the answer to question 1 takes a little knowledge of medicine to evaluate i don t know about iridology but i ve read a book on reflexology which is a remarkably similar notion except that the organs of the body are mapped onto the soles of the feet there are supposed to be channels running down the body carrying information or energy of some sort anatomists have found no such structures always beware the words channel and energy in any spiel put out by an alternative practitioner the answer to question 2 is rather simpler if all they have is anecdotal evidence then forget it ask for referreed papers in mainstream medical journals ignore any bull about the conspiracy of rich doctors suppressing alternative practitioners studies are done and papers are published some of them are even positive the word licensed in the flyer is an interesting one licensed by whom for what it is quite possible that the herbology is real and requires a license you can kill someone by giving them the wrong plants to eat and many plants contain very powerful drugs foxglove and willow spring to mind it is not clear whether the license extends to the iridology and i suspect that if you ask you will be told that it means licensed herbologist and iridologist btw the usual term is herbalist why use a different word

1 | stuff about hardware keys true which is why many of the newer keys ship out oh maybe 32 bits or so have the key encrypt them and return them to the pc making a bunch of these 32 bits part of your program code is a good way to make sure things won t run without the key anyway then this scheme at least defeats your approach it s a little costly though personally i don t believe in copy protection and agree with the thought that the mass inconvenience that it causes all legal users far outweighs the gains from what few pirates won t be able to copy the program

2 | candida can do that to you gordon i think that the best clinical trial for candida blooms would involve giving women with chronic vaginal candida blooms l acidophilus orally and see it it can decrease the frequency and extent of candida blooms in the vagina since most of the candida seems to be migrating in from the anal region and l acidophilus should be able keep the candida in check if it can make it through the intestinal tract and colonize in the anus where it will have access to oxygen just like it does in the vagina as much stuff as there is in the lay press about l acidophilus and vaginal yeast infections i m really amazed that someone has not done a clinical trial yet to check it out the calcium and kidney stone story is not a good reason to throw all conventional wisdom out the window where would medicine be if conventional wisdom had not been used to develop many of the standard medical practices that could not be confirmed through clinical trials the clinical trial is a very new arrival on the medical scene and a very important one the lack of proof that reinnoculation with good bacteria after antibiotic use is important to the health of a patient is no reason to dismiss it out of hand especially if reinnoculation can be done cleaply and safely like it is in animal husbandry
3 | no the thing is designed to be retrievable in a pinch indeed this dictated a rather odd design for the solar arrays since they had to be retractable as well as extendable and may thus have indirectly contributed to the array flapping problems the retrieval problems are exactly as stated it would be costly would involve extensive downtime and the worry of someone finding a reason not to re launch it and would unnecessarily expose the telescope to a lot of mechanical stresses and possibilities for contamination
1 | i don t see any way that the concrete floor could do anything to the battery however you would have been better off leaving them outside keeping them cold would have been better for them than bringing them inside a warm battery will self discharge faster than a cold one when you are storing a battery it s a good idea to charge it once a month letting a battery go completely dead is bad for it i suspect this is what caused your problems

2 | hi my wife has aquired some thyroidal sp deficiency over the past year that gives symptoms such as needing much sleep coldness and proneness to gaining weight she has been to a doctor and taken the ordinary tests and her values were regarded as low the doctor and my wife are not very interested in starting medication as this deactivates the gland giving life long dependency to the drug hormone the last couple of monthes she has been seeing a hoemoepath sp and been given some drops to re activate either her thyroidal gland and or the message center in the brain sorry about the approximate language but i haven t got many clues to what the english terms are but the brain area is called the hypofyse in norwegian my questions are has anyone had heard of success in using this approach her values have been slowly but steadily sinking any comment on the probability of improvement although the doctor has told her to eat normally my wife has dieted vigorously to keep her weight as she feels that is part of keeping an edge over the illness condition may this affect the treatment development i can get the exact figures for her tests for anyone interested and i will greatly value any information opinion experience on this topic i don t intend this post to be either a flaming of the established medical profession or a praise for alternatives i am just relaying events as they have happened sincerely
1 | i thought the first thread was hilarious so here goes another post some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries one year i left the batteries in the garage the garage is unheated they were left in their places that they needed to be one in the riding lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle the battery in the riding lawnmower was about 3 4 years old and one of the cycle batteries was new and one was around 5 years old upon spring time i discovered that all of the batteries were dead and needed to be recharged they all worked properly except for the older ones and they had to be replaced about halfway through the summer they had originally been stored in the garage and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring last year i decided to bring them in to the basement which has two parts one is dirt and brick and the other is concrete i brought in all three and discovered in the spring about 15 days ago that not only were the batteries dead but when i put the charger on them the charger said hmmmmmmmm and the amp meter read around 1 000 000 000 in other words it was pinned the internal circut tripped and i went on to the other batteries they were the same realizing that we still had 2 gigantic sailboat batteries also lead acid i decided to put the charger on them these had been sitting for around 1 and a half years on the brick and dirt part and noticed that they only needed a small charge around 2 hours or so on trickle i tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts and they worked fine for around 25 of em this leads me to believe one of several things 1 i bought really tty batteries last year sorta true 2 the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the batteries 3 there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the room where the concrete is 4 the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air better than concrete btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room
1 | i think it s because the lead gets coated with lead oxide if the battery is not being charged or discharged i remember some advice from an ancient car manual guide my father had which was to use car batteries to power a garage clock or something similar when they re not in a car this is supposed to prevent the oxidation but i ve no idea if it really works the concrete floor connection is a red herring this may contribute to discharging but would be reversible well this is off topic but back in the days when i used to drive bangers i never found wd 40 to do anything that wiping with a dry cloth did nt do i think the effectiveness of wd 40 is a myth invented by the guy who owns the company

1 | this is not a good idea i upgraded my motherboard last fall i would have been quite pissed at any software that would have forced me to reinstall simply because i changed motherboards any info in the bios is too volatile to use as a checksum are you going to require that a user re install all their software if they add 4mb of ram to their computer i did that a couple of weeks ago it s in the bios and if software had told me this isn t the machine you installed me on i would never have used that software again really bad idea this is silly it s much easier to loan disks to a friend and let them do an install than to backup your copy already on disk and then give them that your scheme isn t going to stop anyone do you know any assembly language at all all anyone needs to do if find the part of the code that does the quiz and insert a jmp instruction to just completely skip it not that difficult really and there is very little that commpanies can do to stop this type of thing using pklite or some similar utility would help but only if the resulting compressed exe were tagged as uncompressable this is by far the best idea you presented in your post making it plainly obvious who registered is going to stop casual pirates but the determined ones are just going to answer joe blow to the question of what s your name so this won t stop them in the long run pirates are always going to win this fight they simply have more time to work on the software and figure out the protection scheme steve madsen sjmadsen nextsrv cas muohio edu

2 | edta chelation therapy has been used by some physicians to try to remove calcium from calcified plaques in the arterial system not approved for such use there is also the possibility that lung tissue in patients with lung disease has become calcified chest x rays would show this there are side effects to the use of edta because it is not specific for calcium it also binds other minerals i think that there have been some deaths when edta chelation therapy has been used because of mineral imbalances that were not detected and corrected in animal studies the best way to remove calcium from plaques in rabbits was to supplement the rabbits with vitamin c and magnesium rabbits already synthesize their own vitamin c the extra vitamin c was given in their diets to help the magnesium displace the calcium from the plaques the calcification process that occurs in both plaques and the lung probably can be prevented if magnesium is used in supplemental form most patietns with calcium deposits are found to be deficient in calcium 1 magnesium interrationships in ischemic heart disease a review am j clin nutr 27 1 59 79 1974 supplementation with magnesium will prevent clacification of blood vessels 2 the importance of magnesium deficiency in cardiovascular disease am heart j 94 649 57 1977 the need to measure the serum concentration in all patients with heat disease cannot be overemphasized this is a review article 3 effect of dietary magnesium on development of atherosclerosis in cholesterol fed rabbits atherosclerosis 10 732 7 1990 magnesium supplementation greatly decreased the formation of plaques in rabbits feed a diet that had 1 by weight cholesterrol added to their normal food since edta will also bind magnesium i ve never really liked it s use for the reversal of athersclerosis or now apparently in emphesema patients

2 | a person with a schatzki s ring a membrane partially blocking the espphagus has worsening dysphagia difficulty swallowing and the doctor proposes dilation by balloow or bougie using an inflatable balloon to rupture the ring or a rubber hose to push through it question is balloon dilation safe common and indicated it sounds pretty invasive yes this is a common and safe procedure the majority of schatzki s rings described by x ray however wnd up being due to inflammation instead of the congenital schatzki s ring occassionally a cancer masquerades as a ring you should have the endoscopy to see if it is due to the heartburn and if so you will need treatment for the heartburn ong term the balloon dilation is an alternative to cutting open your chest and cutting out a section of the esophagus so dilation is not at all invasive considering the alternative 3 to 4 years and once was symptomatic from them with some lightheadedness he is young 30 ish thin and in good i not an expert on heart problems but pvc s are common and have been overtreated in the past my personal experience and i have the same history an build you do related to the heart that is is that my pvc s come and go with some months causing anxiety taking on more fluids seems to help and they seem worse in the summer remember that a slow heart rate will allow more pvc s to be apparent so perhaps it is an indication of a healthy cardiac system but ask an expert about that last point especially good luck hope we don t die of arrhythmias god what a happy thought

3 | _the_ problem with oort cloud sources is that absolutely no plausible mechanism has been proposed it would have to involve new physics as far as i can tell closest to conventional oort sources is a model of b field pinching by comets it s got too many holes in it to count but at least it was a good try so you have a plausible model for grb s at astronomical distances recent observations have just about ruled out the merging neutron star hypothesis which had a lot of problems anyhow we have to look for implausible models and what is fundamentally allowed independent of models a paper on the possibility of grb s in the oort cloud just came through the astrophysics abstract service to get a copy of this paper send a message to astro ph babbage sissa it with the subject line get 9304001 here is the abstract of that paper the currently favored explanation for the origin of grbs puts them at cosmological distances but as long as there is no distance indicator to these events all possible sources which are isotropically distributed should remain under consideration this is why the oort cloud of comets is kept on the list although there is no known mechanism for generating grbs from cometary nuclei unlikely as it may seem the possibility that grbs originate in the solar cometary cloud cannot be excluded until it is disproved we use the available data on the distribution of grbs the batse catalogue up to march 1992 and the catalogue of cometary orbits by marsden and williams 1992 to investigate whether there is any observational indication for correlations between the angular distributions of grbs and comets aphelia assuming that the distribution of aphelia direction reflect at least to some extent true variations in the column density of the oort cloud we also apply the vov test to both distributions

1 | there is a cartridge capping upgrade for older deskjet printers available from hewlett packard older original deskjet and possibly deskjet 500 units may have a black plastic slide with rubber capping components in the cartrige parking area on the right side viewed from front of the printer newer printers have a gray or white plastic slide the black plastic slide can allow your cartridge to dry out there was and may still be information packaged with ink cartridges explaining the situation hp placed a coupon for a free upgrade kit to modernize old deskjets to the new capping mechanism i did this on my printer and did indeed find that the cartidges now last longer i don t have the information handy i suggest contacting your nearest hp service center for information on obtaining the kit hp has upgrade kits that consist of electronics and mechanical components that vary depending on the starting level printer and the level to which you wish to upgrade i upgraded my original desket to a dekjet 500 the kit was fairly expensive you are likely better off selling your old printer and purchasing a new deskjet 500 now that prices have declined so much upgrading an original deskjet to 500 requires a fair amount of skill but no soldering upgrading a deskjet plus to a 500 is involves swapping the processor card and changing a few minor parts contact your hp service center for further information the pcl language used by deskjets is considerably different from the pcl used by laser printers especially the newer laser printers the biggest problem is dumb laser drivers that send a raster end command after each scan line this makes no material difference for lasers but causes the deskjet to print the accumulated raster as you might guess the result is hideously slow printing the new dos wordperfect print deskjet drivers are still guilty of this particular behavior from the way wordperfect works this would not be easy to change windows wordperfect works efficiently unless you use the dos drivers instead of windows the pcl4 dialect used in the laserjet iiip allows compression that permits a full page 300 dpi image to be rendered with only one megabyte of memory an uncompressed image could be as large as about 909 kbytes but the printer needs about 300k of memory for its internal house keeping laserjet iv models support banded printing that allows incrmental download of the image with compression in limited memory situations deskjet downloadable fonts are not compatible with laserjet fonts a single page from a laserjet only requires about 20 seconds this is faster than any but the most trivial printing from a deskjet printer the presumption of course being that the laser printer has completed its warm up cyle until ink chemistry is changed wicking resulting in image deterioration is unavoidable i won t use the word impossible but matching laser quality output from a deskjet printer is unlikely chosing an appropriate paper type helps but does not eliminate the problem laser printers are more wastful of energy and consumable components hp does accept return of spent toner cartridges mitigating the material waste problem to a degree energy waste could use more work warm up times have decreased allowing stand by current consumption to be significantly reduced in the laserjet iv kyocera produces a laser print engine that employs an amorphous silicon imaging drum with a replacable toner system the image drum is good for approximately 100k copies it is a very nice print engine i wish hp used the kyocera engine kyocera also has a neat modular paper source and stacker system the recommended duty cycle for a deskjet is significantly lower than any of hp s laser printers the pick up pressure rollers are subject to wear and i case confirm eventually do wear out the usual symptom is that the printer becomes reluctant to feed paper the paper feed is integrated in a transport mechanism that is a single part from hp service replacement cost for the transport is almost 200 the feed rollers are not separately replacable though it would not be a difficult job for a competent technician i have disassembled and reassembled the transport on my own printer it depends upon the application which printer is best for you if you only print 5 or 10 pages a day and are satisfied with the appearance of output the deskjet is a very good choice as noted the deskjet 500 is my choice for personal use

3 | book review the universe of motion by dewey b larson 1984 north pacific publishers portland oregon 456 pages indexed hardcover the universe of motion contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries this book is volume iii of a revised and enlarged edition of the structure of the physical universe 1959 volume i is nothing but motion 1979 and volume ii is the basic properties of matter 1988 most books and journal articles on the subject of astrophysics are bristling with integrals partial differentials and other fancy mathematics in this book by contrast mathematics is conspicuous by its absence except for some relatively simple formulas imbedded in the text larson emphasizes concepts and declares that mathematical agreement with a theory does not guarantee its conceptual validity dewey b larson was a retired engineer with a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed the theory described in his books while trying to find a way to mathematically calculate the properties of chemical compounds based only on the elements they contain the universe of motion describes the astrophysical portions of larson s consistent integrated comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe a kind of grand unified field theory that orthodox physicists and astro physicists claim to be looking for it is built on two postulates about the physical and mathematical nature of space and time 1 the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and with two reciprocal aspects space and time 2 the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its primary magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean from these two postulates larson was able to build a complete theoretical universe from photons and subatomic particles to the giant elliptical galaxies by combining the concept of inward and outward scalar motions with translational vibrational rotational and rotational vibrational motions at each step in the development he was able to match parts of his theoretical universe with corresponding parts in the real physical universe including even things not yet discovered for example in his 1959 book he first predicted the existence of exploding galaxies several years before astronomers started finding them they are a necessary consequence of his comprehensive theory and when quasars were discovered he had a related explanation ready for those also as a result of his theory which he called the reciprocal system larson totally rejected many of the sacred doctrines of orthodox physicists and astrophysicists including black holes neutron stars degenerate matter quantum wave mechanics as applied to atomic structure nuclear physics general relativity relativistic mass increases relativistic doppler shifts nuclear fusion in stars and the big bang all of which he considered to be nothing more than mathematical fantasies he was very critical of the ad hoc assumptions uncertainty principles solutions in principle no other way declarations etc used to maintain them the universe of motion is divided into 31 chapters it begins with a description of how galaxies are built from the gravitational attraction between globular star clusters which are formed from intergalactic gas and dust clouds that accumulate from the decay products of cosmic rays coming in from the anti matter half of the physical universe galaxy formation from the mythical big bang is a big mystery to orthodox astronomers he then goes on to describe life cycles of stars and how binary and multiple star systems and solar systems result from type i supernova explosions of single stars several chapters are devoted to quasars which according to larson are densely packed clusters of stars that have been ejected from the central bulges of exploding galaxies and are actually traveling faster than the speed of light although most of that speed is away from us in time astronomers and astrophysicists who run up against observations that contradict their theories would find larson s explanations quite valuable if considered with an open mind for example they used to believe that gamma ray bursts originated from pulsars which exist primarily in the plane or central bulge of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope in earth orbit observed that the bursts come from all directions uniformly and do not correspond with any visible objects except for a few cases of directional coincidence larson s explanation is that the gamma ray bursts originate from supernova explosions in the anti matter half of the physical universe which larson calls the cosmic sector because the anti matter universe exists in a reciprocal relation to our material universe with the speed of light as the boundary between them and has three dimensions of time and only one dimension of space the bursts can pop into our material universe anywhere seemingly at random larson heavily quotes or paraphrases statements from books journal articles and leading physicists and astronomers in this book 351 of them are superscripted with numbers identifying entries in the reference list at the end of the book for example a quote from the book astronomy the cosmic journey by william k hartmann says

1 | there are several types of copy protection and the point is to make sure the user is using a legitimate copy the simplest and virtually fool proof way is for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on some sort of checksum serial number whatever so a copy put on a different machine not installed from original disks will not work the program is definitely backupable if restored to the same machine depends on the programmer don t use a disk drive characteristic if the user did an upgrade to the machine he she should reinstall all programs any way no document look up no disk wear and tear i did not say that the originals would allow only one install the user s conscience should do that i know i ll get flamed for this but with the increasing number of casual users who either unknowingly or don t care about the software copyrights it s the truth i have friends who ask me for copies of my latest games all the time and when i refused they went after somebody else casual pirating is becoming more of a problem some sort of copy protection will discourage the casual copying i ve seen what some of my friends dug up somewhere latest and the greatest games all cracked within days of actual release you know how many bytes you need to change in x wing to disable the quiz two yes two and don t ask me which ones they are determined pirates are unstoppable given enough time but their results do not spread that far since pirate boards are not that well known and easily tracked once found by authorities it is the casual pirates that the copy protection is determined to discourage what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup registered to xxxxx address city state zip and disables the above two benefits 1 encourages registration 2 cuts down on pirating and makes it more traceable because if the patch s registration message is encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus violated their license agreement this way the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal discomfort who does major upgrades to their computer frequently as only problem they have is they won t be able to restore to another computer the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore gains full rights and can restore to different machines on the other hand the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is supposed to be if this user s copy was found to be somewhere it was not supposed to be we know who has broken their license agreement of course a hacker can break that eventually but that s not the point is it
2 | sounds pretty familiar i posted similar cries about last september when caroline just entered daycare she was two then and have been with continuous colds since until last march as spring approaches her colds slowed down meanwhile we grew more and more relaxed about her colds only once did the doctor diagnosed an ear infection and only twice she had antibiotics the other time was due to sinus infection and i wished that i did not give her that awful septra there are the net studies that is if you read this newsgroup often there will be a round of questions like this every month there might be formal studies like that but bear with my not so academic experience okay gee i bet 50 50 you ll hear cases in all these catagories i am pretty sure an insulated child at home sicks less but that child still will face the world one day that s what i believe and comfort myself with caroline will get more and more colds for sure before she learned not to stick her hand in other kid s mouth nor let other kids do the same cold virus mutate easily however i hope that her immune system will be stronger to fight these diseases so she would be less severely affected everytime she has a cold we make sure she blow her nose frequently and give her dorcol or dimetapp at night so she can have good rest thanks to some suggestions from the net that s about all the care she needs from us i try very hard to keep her off antibiotics twice her ped gave me choice to decide whether she would have antibiotics i waited just long enough 3 4 days to see that she fought the illness off i do understand that you don t have much choice if the child is in pain and or high fever if the child doesn t rely on antibiotics to fight off the sickness everytime then the child should be stronger i ll leave this to expert if your child just entered daycare i m pretty sure the first 6 months will be the hardest then you get more used to it boy do i hate to see me typing this sentence i recall when i read something like this last september i said to myself oh sure but i do get used to it now however i do hear people say that it does get better after a year or two i am looking forward to a healthier next winter as it gets warmer i hope you do get some break soon eat well sleep well try not to use antibiotics if not absolutely necessary good luck wen lin
2 | being a chronic hbsag carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic persistent anything persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical biochemical or histologic evidence of liver disease or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis cph are probably the result of a viral infection although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined the diagnosis of cph is made on the basis of liver biopsy it consists of findings of portal inflammation an intact periportal limiting plate and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis but in contrast to chronic active hepatitis cah there is no periportal inflammation bridging necrosis or fibrosis cph has indeed an excellent prognosis if i had to choose between cah and cph there is no question i would also choose cph however as david pointed out the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal with biopsies showing areas compatible with both cph and cah maybe it is a sampling problem maybe it is a continuum i don t know

1 | the lead acid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following chemical reaction pb pbo2 2h2so4 2pbso4 2h20 lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water the standard heats of formation at 25 c 77 f of the various compounds are heat of formation compound at 25 c kcal mole pb 0 00 pbo2 65 0 h2so4 193 69 pbso4 218 5 h20 68 3174 the heat of reaction at 25 c is therefore 60 6 kcal per mole pbso4 produced note that lead sulfate is not very soluble 0 0048 grams per 100 grams water at 25 c and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the battery i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but i may be wrong oh well i don t have a corroded battery to corrobate and i don t feel like thinking through it right now what is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exothermic or energy discharging if moisture with dissolved electrolytes acid rain condenses on the battery a conductive path between the terminals may form this will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds the reaction is reversible if electricity from an alternator or battery charger is put back into the battery lead acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction the non reacting posts terminals of the lead acid battery are there to remove or add electric energy during a discharge or charge because the reaction is exothermic it has a tendency to happen though quite slowly under normal circumstances so while keeping the battery dry is a good idea it is not a total solution to understand why lead acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechatelier s principle which can be paraphrased as anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials thermal conductivity material temperature c f btu hr ft ft f ft diatomaceous earth 204 0 051 natural across strata 871 0 077 diatomaceous natural 204 0 081 parallel to strata 871 0 106 diatomaceous earth powder 100 0 039 density 18 lb cu ft 200 0 042 300 0 044 400 0 048 500 0 051 concrete cinder 0 20 stone 0 54 1 4 dry 0 44 pine across grain 15 0 087 parallel to grain 21 0 20 oak across grain 15 0 12 maple across grain 50 0 11 note that the thermal conductivity for dirt diatomaceous earth goes down with temperature also 204 c is about 400 k and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth the thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of 10 greater than that of dirt and is 2 4 times greater than wood it is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood at any instant the discharge reaction is occurring energy is being released either as electricity or heat thermal conductivity of air is about 0 015 btu hr ft ft f ft during storage except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery this energy is mostly released as heat the higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface thus if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about 10 times faster than that on dirt this is where lechatelier s principle comes into play removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement and you have 3 surfaces removing energy which pulls the reaction along also if water evaporates from the battery that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water this will tend to drive the discharge reaction jeff white jhwhit01 ulkyvx louisville edu

1 | heats of formation deleted the major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an acid solution pbso4 is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out also h2so4 is in a water solution as 2h30 and so4 thus the heats of formation of pbso4 and h2so4 are for the most part irrelevant as it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic heat producing more about this later what actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this we re talking lead acid batteries of course the battery slowly self discharges as this discharge takes place two things happen the level of pb ions in the acid solution increases i e the lead and lead oxide plates are dissolved the level of h30 ions in the acid solution decreases i e the solution becomes less acidic or more like water if you like now as the post to which i am responding correctly stated pbso4 will precipitate in a water non acid solution when the battery dies i e is fully discharged we end up with a high concentration of pb and so4 in water so pbso4 forms in the solution and falls to the bottom of the battery of course this happens in varying degrees the more discharged the more precipitate forms the precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery if there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate more common in a newer battery a dead short results i have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition but they are for the most part useless they can dissolve the pbso4 but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates properly you may have some success with these products for a newer battery stuff deleted stuff deleted this stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid in fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher temperatures a logical consequence of the above argument is this if you really want your car to start lower the battery temperature to 50 to pull the reaction along we all know from experience at least those of us in canada do it gets cold up here that this is not true if we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the battery besides which there is not enough energy released through self discharge to appreciably raise the temperature the air would amply dissipate any such heat whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not this is of course irrelevant since you would want the battery to be cool during storage

3 | my information shows that the last san marco launch was 1988 there seem to have been a total of seven before that i seem to recall that someone either asi or the university of rome includes money in their annual budget for maintainance of the platforms there are actually two the italians have been spending money to develop an advanced scout however recent events in the italian space program and the italian government overall make me skeptical that this will get off the ground in the near future

2 | allergy medicine huh is this just to get rid of the resultant migraine or whatever or does it actually suppress allergic reactions i e like an antihistamine does as far as doctors over here are concerned if you slip up and eat something you re allergic to even if they won t test you to tell you what to avoid then tough if a _cheap_ medicine will alleviate your symptoms then fine otherwise you just suffer one doctor did prescribe me imigran costs the nhs 48 for 6 tablets after having to rehydrate me because i d been throwing up for four solid days and couldn t even drink water but i got taken off it again when i moved and had to change doctors reasoning they did not know what the side effects were because it was new ok fine but it has passed the safety tests to get on the prescription list and anyway i was prepared to take the risk to have quality of life now the only alternatives i have is to get it prescribed privately which i cannot afford or to pay a private allergy specialist to test me and tell me what to avoid i am fairly certain i am allergic to more than one chemical additive as a lot of things i can t eat have nothing in common except things i know are safe so testing myself isn t really an option there are too many permutations
3 | the main effect of the spherical aberration problems with the primary mirror was to drive the computer engineers to develop the image processing software that much faster when they use the _same_ deconvolution software on the images from the fixed hubble be ready for some incredible results there is every reason to believe that the results will _exceed_ the original specs by a fair margin adaptive optics is a combination of hardware and software it works realtime not after the fact as is the case with hubble you might be interested to know this technology has made it to the amateur market in the form of the ao 2 adaptive optics system starting on page 52 of the april 1993 sky telescope is a three page review of this new product it lists for 1 290 the article states the ao 2 adaptive optics system comes in a handy soft plastic case that a three year old could carry around even though this device is really only good for the brightest objects it could cope with image movements of up to 0 8 millimeter in the telescope s focal plane now just imagine how well this infant technology will do in a few years especially in a dedicated system that has hundreds of thousands of dollars and many man hours invested in its development george krumins

2 | i think i can explain the missing part of a leaf story i have actually seen a reproduction of that particular kirlian photograph in a book compiled by people who were enthusiasts of kirlian photography that particular photograph that s right the effect has been observed only once even the writers of the book were inclined to disbelieve in it i conjecture that the maker of that photograph began by placing a whole leaf between two plates and taking its kirlian photo for his next experiment he cut the leaf in half put one half down between the same two plates and took another k p the missing half effect was created by water oils etc left behind after the first photo this explanation must be tentative because after all i wasn t there when it happened
3 | well here goes the first item of business is to establish the importance space life sciences in the whole of scheme of humankind i mean compared to football and baseball the average joe schmoe doesn t seem interested or even curious about spaceflight i think that this forum can make a major change in that lack of insight and education all of us in our own way can contribute to a comprehensive document which can be released to the general public around the world the document would scientifically analyze the technical aspects of long term human habitation in space i believe that if any long term space exploration program is to succeed we need to basically learn how to engineer our own microworld i e the spacecraft only through the careful analyses of engineering chemical biological and medical factors will a good ecosystem be created to facilitate human life on a long duration flight so i would like to see posts of opinions regarding the most objective methods to analyze the accepted scientific literature for technologies which can be applied to long duration spaceflight such a detailed literature search would be of interest to ourselves as space advocates and clearly important to existing space programs in essence we would be dividing the space life science issues into various technical problems which could be solved with various technologies this database of acceptable solutions to various problems could form the basis of detailed discussions involving people from the bionet isunet and any other source

2 | i don t know the first thing about yeast infections but i am a scientist no scientist would take your statement no convincing empirical evidence to support the existence of systemic yeast syndrome to tell you anything except an absence of data on the question noring has pointed out the catch 22 that if the crazy theory were true you probably couldn t find any direct evidence of it that you couldn t observe those yeastie beasties with present methods even if they were there noring and the fellow from oklahoma sorry forgot your name have also suggested one set of anecdotal evidence in favor based on their personal experiences namely that when people with certain conditions are given anti fungals many of them appear to get better so if you have any evidence against the hypothesis for example controlled double blind studies showing that the anti fungals don t do any better than sugar water then let s hear it if you don t then what we have is anecdotal and uncontrolled evidence on one side and abject disbelief on the other in which case please there is no point in yelling back and forth at each other any longer since neither side has any convincing evidence either positive or negative and i understand that your abject disbelief is based on the existence of people who may get famous or make money applying the diagnosis to everything in sight making wild claims with no evidence and always refusing to do controlled studies but that has absolutely no bearing on the apparently sincere experiences of the people on the net observing anti fungals working on themselves and other people in certain specific cases there are also quacks who sell oral superoxide dismutase in spite of the fact that it s completely broken down in the guts but this doesn t change the genuine scientific knowledge about the role of superoxide dismutase in fighting oxidative damage same thing just cause there are candida quacks that doesn t establish evidence against the candida hypothesis if there s some other reason besides the quacks if only anecdotal to think it could be true then that is what has to be considered that is what the net people have been talking about but again there is no point in arguing about it there is anecdotal evidence and there is no convincing evidence and there are also some candida quacks out there i hope everyone can agree on all of that thus it appears to me the main question now is whether the proponents can marshall enough anecdotal evidence in a convincing and documented enough manner to make a good case for carrying out a good controlled double blind study of antifungals or else forget convincing anybody else to carry out the test just carry it out themselves and also whether they can adequately define the patient population or symptoms on which such a study should be carried out to provide a fair test of the hypothesis ken

2 | there are two different mechanisms here toning of muscles and reduction of fat exercises specific to particular muscles will tone only those muscles exercised example look at differences in arm circumferences between pitching arms and non pitching arms in major league pitchers however if exercise also leads to reduction of body fat the loss of body fat will be equally distributed over the entire body there is no way to spot reduce body fat other than surgically through liposuction distribution of body fat is genetically determined sometimes a very flabby muscle will look like fat so when that muscle gains some muscle tone it may appear as though the fat is changing into muscle but really fat and muscle tissues are totally separate and one does not ever change into the other
3 | i disagree with what to tout although i agree that the space program is inherently a good thing most people today only care about what will it cost me and what s in it for me and could care less about whether something is simply worthwhile in and of itself our society has become increasingly geared toward the short term which you could read as now they couldn t care less about next week much less next century they want something to show for the expenditure and they want it now i think we should tell them about the things that they are using now that are spinoffs of the space program that is the only way you can prove its worth to them and they vote and pay taxes too the continued existence of the space program relies upon that money just my 02 btw don t forget velcro

2 | first off if i m not mistaken only hibernating animals have brown fat not humans secondly your description sounds just like 2 4 dinitrophenol this is an uncoupler of respiratory chain oxidative phosphorylation put in layman s terms it short circuits the mitochondria causing food energy to be turned into heat 2 4 dnp was popular in the 1930 s for weight reduction in controlled amounts it raises body temperature as the body compensates for the reduced amount of useful energy available it is very dangerous it would be wiser to adjust to your present body form rather than play around with 2 4 dnp

2 | as a matter of fact i just saw a dermatologist the other day and while i was there i asked him about dry skin i d been spending a small fortune on various creams lotions and other dry skin treatments he said all i needed was a large jar of vaseline soak in a lukewarm tub of water for 10 minutes only 10 minutes then massage in the vaseline to trap the moisture in that will help i haven t tried it yet but you can bet i will the hard part will be finding the time to rub in the vaseline properly if it s not done right you remain greasy and stick to your clothes try it it s got to be cheaper then spending 30 for 8 oz of natural lotion
2 | the acetaminophen is the agent of concern in overdose of this otc medication a single dose of acetaminophen of 10 grams or greater can cause hepatotoxicity and doses of 25 grams or more are potentially fatal from hepatic necrosis if i recall correctly the metabolism of acetaminophen at high doses involves n hydroxylation to n acetyl benzoquinoneimine which is a highly reactive intermediate which then reacts with sulfhydryl groups of proteins and glutathione when hepatic glutathione is used up this intermediate then starts attacking the hepatic proteins with resulting hepatic necrosis the insidious part of acetaminophen toxicity is the delay 2 4 days between ingestion and clinical signs of liver damage this is not a nice way to die as to taking 20 30 of these tablets that comes to 5 7 5 grams of acetaminophen in a normal adult this would probably cause nausea vomiting abdominal pain and loss of appetite

centers for disease control and prevention mmwr rates of cesarean delivery united states 1991 source mmwr 42 15 date apr 23 1993 cesarean deliveries have accounted for nearly 1 million of the approximately 4 million annual deliveries in the united states since 1986 table 1 the cesarean rate in the united states is the third highest among 21 reporting countries exceeded only by brazil and puerto rico 1 this report presents data on cesarean deliveries from cdc s national hospital discharge survey nhds for 1991 and compares these data with previous years data on discharges from short stay nonfederal hospitals have been collected annually since 1965 in the nhds conducted by cdc s national center for health statistics for 1991 medical and demographic information were abstracted from a sample of 274 000 inpatients discharged from 484 participating hospitals the 1991 cesareans and vaginal births after a prior cesarean vbac presented in this report are based on weighted national estimates from the nhds sample of approximately 31 000 11 women discharged after delivery the estimated numbers of live births by type of delivery were calculated by applying cesarean rates from the nhds to live births from national vital registration data therefore estimates of the number of cesareans in this report will not agree with previously published data based solely on the nhds 2 stated differences in this analysis are significant at the 95 confidence level based on the two tailed t test with a critical value of 1 96 in 1991 there were 23 5 cesareans per 100 deliveries the same rate as in 1990 and similar to rates during 1986 1989 table 1 the primary cesarean rate i e number of first cesareans per 100 deliveries to women who had no previous cesareans for 1986 1991 also was stable ranging from 16 8 to 17 5 in 1991 the cesarean rate in the south was 27 6 significantly p 0 05 higher than the rates for the west 19 8 midwest 21 8 and northeast 22 6 rates were higher for mothers aged greater than or equal to 30 years than for younger women in proprietary hospitals than in nonprofit or government hospitals in hospitals with fewer than 300 beds than in larger hospitals and for deliveries for which blue cross blue shield and other private insurance is the expected source of payment than for other sources of payment table 2 the same pattern characterized primary cesarean deliveries since the early 1970s the number and percentage of births to older women increased however if the age distribution of mothers in 1991 had remained the same as in 1986 the overall cesarean rate in 1991 would have been 23 3 essentially the same as the 23 5 observed based on the nhds of the approximately 4 111 000 live births in 1991 an hicnet medical newsletter page 1 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 estimated 966 000 23 5 were by cesarean delivery of these an estimated 338 000 35 0 births were repeat cesareans and 628 000 65 0 were primary cesareans since 1986 approximately 600 000 primary cesareans have been performed annually in 1986 8 5 of women who had a previous cesarean delivered vaginally compared with 24 2 in 1991 of all cesareans in 1991 35 0 were associated with a previous cesarean 30 4 with dystocia i e failure of labor to progress 11 7 with breech presentation 9 2 with fetal distress and 13 7 with all other specified complications the average hospital stay for all deliveries in 1991 was 2 8 days in comparison the hospital stay for a primary cesarean delivery was 4 5 days and for a repeat cesarean 4 2 days nearly twice the duration for vbac deliveries 2 2 days or for vaginal deliveries that were not vbacs 2 3 days in 1986 the average hospital stay for all deliveries was 3 2 days for primary cesareans 5 2 days for repeat cesareans 4 7 days and for vbac and non vbac vaginal deliveries 2 7 and 2 6 days respectively reported by office of vital and health statistics systems national center for health statistics cdc editorial note the cesarean rate in the united states steadily increased from 1965 through 1986 however the findings in this report indicate that rates have been stable since 1986 3 because there is little evidence that maternal and child health status has improved during this time and because cesareans are associated with an increased risk for complications of childbirth a national health objective for the year 2000 4 is to reduce the overall cesarean rate to 15 or fewer per 100 deliveries and the primary cesarean rate to 12 or fewer per 100 deliveries objective 14 8 postpartum complications including urinary tract and wound infections may account in part for the longer hospital stays for cesarean deliveries than for vaginal births 5 moreover the prolonged hospital stays for cesarean deliveries substantially increase health care costs for example in 1991 the average costs for cesarean and vaginal deliveries were 7826 and 4720 respectively the additional cost for each cesarean delivery includes 611 for physician fees and 2495 for hospital charges 6 if the cesarean rate in 1991 had been 15 the year 2000 objective instead of 23 5 the number of cesarean births would have decreased by 349 000 617 000 versus 966 000 resulting in a savings of more than 1 billion in physician fees and hospital charges despite the steady increase in vbac rates since 1986 several factors may impede progress toward the year 2000 national health objectives for cesarean delivery for example vbac rates substantially reflect the number of women offered trial of labor which has been increasingly encouraged since 1982 7 of women who are offered a trial of labor 50 70 could deliver vaginally 7 a level already achieved by many hospitals 8 trial of labor was routinely offered in 46 of hospitals surveyed in 1984 the most recent year for which hicnet medical newsletter page 2 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 national data are available 9 when the vbac rate according to nhds data was 5 7 the year 2000 objective specifies a vbac rate of 35 based on all women who had a prior cesarean regardless of whether a trial of labor was attempted to reach the overall cesarean rate goal however increases in the vbac rate will need to be combined with a substantial reduction in the primary rate one hospital succeeded in reducing the rate of cesarean delivery by applying objective criteria for the four most common indications for cesarean delivery by requiring a second opinion and by instituting a peer review process 10 other recommendations for decreasing cesarean delivery rates include eliminating incentives for physicians and hospitals by equalizing reimbursement for vaginal and cesarean deliveries public dissemination of physician and hospital specific cesarean delivery rates to increase public awareness of differences in practices and addressing malpractice concerns which may be an important factor in maintaining the high rates of cesarean delivery 4 references 1 notzon fc international

because of increasing drug resistance although the risk of acquiring malaria for u s citizens and their dependents stationed overseas generally has been low this risk varies substantially and unpredictably during may 1992 the office of medical services department of state oms dos and cdc were notified of an increased number of malaria cases among official u s personnel stationed in kampala uganda a review of the health records from the embassy health unit ehu in kampala indicated that 27 cases of malaria were diagnosed in official personnel from march through june 1992 compared with two cases during the same period in 1991 ehu oms dos and cdc conducted an investigation to confirm all reported malaria cases and identify potential risk factors for malaria among u s embassy personnel this report summarizes the results of the investigation malaria blood smears from 25 of the 27 reported case patients were available for review by oms dos and cdc a case of malaria was confirmed if the slide was positive for plasmodium sp of the 25 persons 17 were slide confirmed as having malaria a questionnaire was distributed to all persons served by the ehu to obtain information about residence activities use of malaria chemoprophylaxis and use of personal protection measures i e using bednets and insect repellents having window and door screens and wearing long sleeves and pants in the evening of the 157 persons eligible for the survey 128 82 responded risk for malaria was not associated with sex or location of residence in kampala although the risk for malaria was higher among children aged less than or equal to 15 years 6 32 19 than among persons greater than 15 years 11 94 12 this difference was not significant relative risk rr 1 6 95 confidence interval ci 0 6 4 0 eighty two percent of the cases occurred among persons who had been living in kampala for 1 5 years compared with those living there less than 1 year travel outside of the kampala area to more rural settings was not associated with increased risk for malaria four malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens were used by persons who participated in the survey mefloquine chloroquine and proguanil chloroquine

uganda office of medical svcs dept of state washington d c malaria br div of parasitic diseases national center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note in uganda the increase in malaria among u s personnel was attributed to poor adherence to both recommended malaria chemoprophylaxis regimens and use of personal protection measures during a period of increased malaria transmission and intensified chloroquine resistance in sub saharan africa the findings in this report underscore the need to provide initial and continued counseling regarding malaria prevention for persons living abroad in malaria endemic areas preventive measures that are also important for short term travelers to such areas mefloquine is an effective prophylaxis regimen in africa and in most other areas with chloroquine resistant p falciparum however in some areas e g thailand resistance to mefloquine may limit its effectiveness in africa the efficacy of mefloquine compared with chloroquine alone in preventing infection with p falciparum is 92 1 mefloquine is safe and well tolerated when given at 250 mg per week over a 2 year period the risk for serious adverse reactions possibly associated with mefloquine prophylaxis e g psychosis and convulsions is low i e 1 3 1 9 episodes per 100 000 users 2 while the risk for less severe adverse reactions e g dizziness gastrointestinal complaints and sleep disturbances is similar to that for other antimalarial chemoprophylactics 1 doxycycline has similar prophylactic efficacy to mefloquine but the need for daily dosing may reduce compliance with and effectiveness of this regimen 3 4 chloroquine alone is not effective as prophylaxis in areas of intense chloroquine resistance e g southeast asia and africa in africa for persons who cannot take

vaccine for infants and children source mmwr 42 15 date apr 23 1993 haemophilus influenzae type b hib conjugate vaccines have been recommended for use in infants since 1990 and their routine use in infant vaccination has contributed to the substantial decline in the incidence of hib disease in the united states 1 3 vaccines against diphtheria tetanus and pertussis during infancy and childhood have been administered routinely in the united states since the late 1940s and has been associated with a greater than 90 reduction in morbidity and mortality associated with infection by these organisms because of the increasing number of vaccines now routinely recommended for infants a high priority is the development of combined vaccines that allow simultaneous administration with fewer separate injections the food and drug administration fda recently licensed two new products for vaccinating children against these diseases 1 the haemophilus b conjugate vaccine tetanus toxoid conjugate acthib trademark for vaccination against hib disease only and 2 a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole cell pertussis vaccine dtp and hib conjugate vaccine tetramune trademark a combination of vaccines formulated for use in vaccinating children against diphtheria tetanus pertussis and hib disease acthib trademark on march 30 1993 the fda approved a new haemophilus b conjugate vaccine polyribosylribitol phosphate tetanus toxoid conjugate prp t manufactured by pasteur merieux serum et vaccins and distributed as acthib trademark by connaught laboratories inc swiftwater pennsylvania this vaccine has been licensed for use in infants in a three dose primary vaccination series administered at ages 2 4 and 6 months previously unvaccinated infants 7 11 months of age should receive two doses 2 months apart previously unvaccinated children 12 14 months of age should receive one dose a booster dose administered at 15 months of age is recommended for all children previously unvaccinated children 15 59 months of age should receive a single dose and do not require a booster more than 90 of infants receiving a primary vaccination series of acthib trademark consecutive doses at 2 4 and 6 months of age develop a geometric mean titer of anti haemophilus b polysaccharide antibody greater than 1 ug ml 4 this response is similar to that of infants who receive recommended series of previously licensed haemophilus b conjugate vaccines for which efficacy has been demonstrated in prospective trials two u s efficacy trials of prp t were terminated early because of the concomitant licensure of other haemophilus b conjugate vaccines hicnet medical newsletter page 8 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 for use in infants 4 in these studies no cases of invasive hib disease were detected in approximately 6000 infants vaccinated with prp t these and other studies suggest that the efficacy of prp t vaccine will be similar to that of the other licensed hib vaccines tetramune trademark on march 30 1993 the fda approved a combined diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and whole cell pertussis vaccine dtp and haemophilus b conjugate vaccine tetramune trademark available from lederle praxis biologicals pearl river new york combines two previously licensed products dtp triimmunol registered manufactured by lederle laboratories pearl river new york and haemophilus b conjugate vaccine hibtiter registered manufactured by praxis biologics inc rochester new york this vaccine has been licensed for use in children aged 2 months 5 years for protection against diphtheria tetanus pertussis and hib disease when indications for vaccination with dtp vaccine and haemophilus b conjugate vaccine coincide based on demonstration of co mparable or higher antibody responses to each of the components of the two vaccines tetramune trademark is expected to provide protection against hib as well as diphtheria tetanus and pertussis equivalent to that of already licensed formulations of other dtp and haemophilus b vaccines the advisory committee for immunization practices acip recommends that all infants receive a primary series of one of the licensed haemophilus b conjugate vaccines beginning at 2 months of age and a booster dose at age 12 15 months 5 the acip also recommends that all infants receive a four dose primary series of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and pertussis vaccine at 2 4 6 and 15 18 months of age and a booster dose at 4 6 years 6 8 a complete statement regarding recommendations for use of acthib trademark and tetramune trademark is being

explores oral manifestations of hiv infection nidr research digest written by jody dove march 1993 national institute of dental research at the second international workshop on the oral manifestations of hiv infection held january 31 february 3 in san francisco participants explored issues related to the epidemiology basic molecular virology mucosal immunology and oral clinical presentations of hiv infection the workshop was organized by dr john greenspan and dr deborah greenspan of the department of stomatology school of dentistry university of california san francisco an international steering committee and scientific program committee provided guidance the conference drew more than 260 scientists from 39 countries including asia africa europe central america south america as well as the united states and canada support tor the workshop was provided by the national institute of dental research the national cancer institute the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases the nih office of aids research and the procter and gamble company among the topics discussed were the epidemiology of hiv lesions ethics professional responsibility and public policy occupational issues provision of oral care to the hiv positive population salivary hiv transmission and mucosal immunity opportunistic infections pediatric hiv infection and women s issues recommendations recommendations emerged from the workshop to define the association between the appearance of oral lesions and rate of progression of hiv to establish a universal terminology for hiv associated oral lesions to look for more effective treatments for oral manifestations to expand molecular biology studies to understand the relationship between hiv infection and common oral lesions and to study the effects of hiv therapy on oral lesions epidemiology since the first international workshop on oral manifestations of hiv infection was convened five years ago the epidemiology of hiv infection has hicnet medical newsletter page 11 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 radically changed in 1988 hiv infection was detected and reported largely in homosexual and bisexual males intravenous drug users and hemophiliacs today more hiv infection is seen in heterosexual males and females and in children and adolescents while the predominant impact of hiv infection has been felt in africa a major increase in infection rate is being seen in southeast asia as well five hundred thousand cases have been reported to date in this region and more are appearing all the time researchers are continuing to document the epidemiology of oral lesions such as hairy leukoplakia and candidiasis they also are beginning to explore the relationships between specific oral lesions and hiv disease progression and prognosis social political issues discussion on the social and political implications of hiv infection focused on changing the public s attitude that aids is retribution for indiscriminate sexual behavior and drug use speakers also addressed health care delivery for hiv infected patients and the need to educate the public about what aids is and how it is acquired saliva and salivary glands conference speakers described transmission issues and the hiv inhibitory activity of saliva the strength of which varies among the different salivary secretions whole saliva has a greater inhibitory effect than submandibular secretions which in turn have a greater inhibitory effect than parotid secretions research has shown that at least two mechanisms are responsible for salivary inhibitory activity they attributed the hiv inhibitory effect of saliva to the 1 aggregation agglutination of hiv by saliva which may both promote clearance of virus and prevent it reaching a target cell and 2 direct effects on the virus or target cells other topics discussed were the manifestation of salivary gland disease in hiv infected persons and current research on oral mucosal immunity pediatric issues pediatric aids recently has emerged as an area of intense interest with early and accurate diagnosis and proper treatment the life expectancy of hiv infected children has tripled the prevention of transmission of hiv from mother to child may be possible in many cases particularly if the mother s sero status is known prior to giving birth periodontal and gingival tissue disease hicnet medical newsletter page 12 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 oral health researchers continue to explore periodontal diseases and gingivitis found in individuals with hiv infection recommendations made at the workshop include the standardization of terminology refinement of diagnostic markers standardization of study design and proper consideration of confounding variables resulting from periodontal therapy occupational and treatment issues occupational issues surrounding the treatment of hiv infected individuals and treatment rendered by hiv infected health care professionals still command considerable attention factors under consideration include the cost benefit of hiv testing patient to health care provider transmission of hiv infection and the reverse and the use of mainstream versus dedicated facilities for the treatment of hiv infected patients conference participants anticipate that a third international workshop on the oral manifestations of hiv infection will be held in five years or less proceedings from the second workshop will be published by the quintessence company in late 1993 end of part 1
1 | this has been an interesting thread to follow and obviously this group wasn t intended as a forum for the discussion of piracy has anyone seen any estimates of the lost revenue due to pirates i was wondering if piracy is more rampant in home or corporate computing environments i would tend to think that business environment piracy is the major contributor to this form of lost revenue so many companies will purchase a few copies of a software package and then employees will internally distribute them as if they owned a site license what do you guys think

2 | i ve seen people in their forties and fifties become disoriented and demented during hospital stays in the examples i ve seen drugs were definitely involved my own father turned into a vegetable for a short time while in the hospital he was fifty three at the time and he was on 21 separate medications the family protested but the doctors were adamant telling us that none of the drugs interact they even took the attitude that if he was disoriented they should put him on something else as well with the help of an md friend of the family we had all his medication discontinued he had a seizure that night and was put back on one drug two days later he was his old self again i guess there aren t many medical texts that address the subject of 21 way interactions i don t mean this as a cheap shot at the medical profession it is an aspect of hospitals that is very frightening to me docs seem to believe that because they have close control of you it s quite all right to take your bodily equilibria into their own hands that control reduces the chance that the patient will make a mistake but health care providers can make mistakes too and mistakes can be deadly under those circumstances i grant you that sometimes there s no choice nevertheless i suggest you procure a list of the drugs your grandmother is getting and discuss it with an independent doc her problems may not be the effect of haldol at all haldol may have been used validly or it may have been prescribed because other medication confused her and because the hospital normally prescribes haldol for the confused elderly just my opinion

were performed over dss 14 63 goldstone madrid 70 meter antennas and dss 14 43 goldstone canberra 70 meter antennas respectively initial results indicate the delta dor pass on april 22 was unsuccessful due to ground station hardware problems but the one on april 23 was successfully performed 2 on april 23 a cruise science memory readout mro was performed for the magnetometer mag instrument analysis indicates the data was received properly 3 on april 23 the spare power relay contacts were commanded closed via the spacecraft stored sequence these relays were commanded closed by the cds command data subsystem prior to launch and were again commanded closed to preclude the possibility at jupiter of the pps relays wiring being a source of internal electrostatic charge iesd 4 on april 26 cruise science memory readouts mro were performed for the extreme ultraviolet spectrometer euv dust detector dds and magnetometer mag instruments preliminary analysis indicates the data was received properly 5 during the period from april 26 to april 27 a navigation cycle was performed this navigation cycle provided near continuous acquisition of two way doppler and ranging data during three consecutive passes of the spacecraft over dss 63 dss 14 and dss 43 6 on april 26 real time commands were sent to test slew the radio relay antenna rra in preparation for the mini sequence slew test on april 28 the rra was slewed from approximately 3 5 degrees from stow to approximately 20 3 degrees preliminary analysis indicated the antenna slewed to about 18 degrees which was well within the predicted range the rra was commanded back to approximately 15 2 degrees from stow preliminary analysis indicated the antenna reached about 15 8 degrees also well within the predicted range the rra motor temperature was at 1 degree c at the start of the activity and had increased to 1 6 degrees c at its completion after verifying proper rra slewing the rra slew test mini sequence was uplinked to the spacecraft for execution on april 28 upon successful uplink a delayed action command dac was sent which will reposition the stator on may 4 to its initial pre test position also a dac was sent to turn the two way noncoherent twnc on april 28 prior to the start of the rra slew test mini sequence 7 on april 27 a no op command was sent to reset the command loss timer to 264 hours its planned value during this mission phase 8 on april 28 the rra slew test executed nominally the spacecraft under stored sequence control performed six rra slews starting at about 16 degrees from stow and going to 53 degrees back to 25 degrees then to 51 degrees back to 22 degrees then to 48 degrees and then back to 21 degrees all of the slews were well within the predicted range the rra motor temperature was at 2 3 degrees c at the start of the activity and had increased to 4 4 degrees c at its completion after completion of the rra slews real time commands were sent to reconfigure back to

3 | this was all badly reported in the news there is no evidence that signs of life found in old rock predate putative planet sterilizing events rather the argument was that if life arose shortly the last sterilizing event then it must be easily formed the inference was that life originated before and was destroyed but there was no evidence of that however even this argument is flawed it could well be that origin of life requires specific conditions say a certain composition of the atmosphere that do not last for long so perhaps life formed early only because it would have had no other chance to do so not because it was likely that life would originate under those conditions

us that the majority of americans believe that doctors make too much money the pollsters also asked what a fair income would be for physicians those polled said oh about 80 000 a year would be ok how generous how sporting how stupid why is this poll stupid because it is based on resentment and envy two emotions that ran hot during the political campaign and are still simmering you could conduct the same kind of poll about any group that earns 100 000 plus and get the same results since the majority of americans don t make those bucks they assume that those who do are stealing it from them maybe the berlin wall came down but don t kid yourself karl marx lives it s also stupid because it didn t ask key questions such as do you know how much education and training it takes to become a physician if those polled said no they didn t know then they should have been disqualified if they gave the wrong answers they should have been dropped what good are their views on how much a doctor should earn if they don t know what it takes to become a doctor or maybe a question should have been phrased this way how much should a person earn if he or she must a get excellent grades and a fine educational foundation in high school in order to b be accepted by a good college and spend four years taking courses heavy in math physics chemistry and other lab work and maintain a 3 5 average or better and c spend four more years of grinding study in medical school with the third and fourth years in clinical training working 80 to 100 hours a week and d spend another year as a low pay hard work intern and e put in another three to 10 years of post graduate training depending on your specialty and f maybe wind up 100 000 in debt after medical school and g then work an average of 60 hours a week with many family doctors putting in 70 hours or more until they retire or fall over as you have probably guessed by now i have considerably more respect for doctors than does the law firm of clinton and clinton and all the lawyers and insurance executives they have called together to remake america s health care based on what doctors contribute to society they are far more useful than the power happy ego tripping program spewing social tinkerers who will probably give us a medical plan that is to health what clinton s first budget is to frugality but propaganda works and as the stupid poll indicates many americans wrongly believe that profiteering doctors are the major cause of high medical costs of course doctors are well compensated they should be americans now live longer than ever but who is responsible for our longevity lawyers congress or the guy flipping burgers in a mcdonald s and the doctors prolong our lives despite our having become a nation of self indulgent lard butted tv gaping couch cabbages ah that is not something you heard president clinton or super spouse talk about during the campaign or since but instead of trying to turn the medical profession into a villain let us talk about medical care and one of the biggest problems we have that problem is you my fellow american yes you eating too much and eating the wrong foods many of you guzzling too much hooch still puffing away at 2 50 a pack getting your daily exercise by lumbering from the fridge to the microwave to the couch doing dope and bringing crack babies into the world filling the big city emergency rooms with gunshot victims engaging in unsafe sex and catching a deadly disease while blaming the world for not finding an instant cure you and your habits not the doctors are the single biggest health problem in this country if anything it is amazing that the docs keep you alive as long as they do in fact i don t understand how they can stand looking at your blubbery bods all day so as your president i call upon you to stop whining and start living cleanly now i must go get myself a triple cheesy greasy with double fries do as i say not as i do but for those who truly believe that doctors are overpaid there is another solution don t use them that s right you don t feel well then try one of those spine poppers needle twirlers or have rev bubba lay his hands upon your head and declare you fit or there is the do it yourself approach you have chest pains then sit in front of a mirror make a slit here a slit there and pop in a couple of valves you re going to have a kid why throw your money at that overpaid sawbones so he can buy a better car and a bigger house than you will ever have while paying more in taxes and malpractice insurance than you will ever earn just have the kid the old fashioned way squat and do it and if it survives you can go to the library and find a book on how to give it its shots by the way has anyone ever done a poll on how much pollsters should earn royko is a pulitzer prize winning columnist for tribune media services ____________________________________________________________________________

1 | hi i am looking for a very high speed d a converter at least 8bits and 150mhz for a research application a paper in the january issue of ieee solid state circuits mentions a gaas 1ghz 8bit dac anyone know where i can find such a thing even a somewhat slower si dac would do needless to say i have looked in all the conventional places vitesse motorola national etc etc any pointers would be appreciated
1 | if you want slow led flash rates adjustable by switches or by a 4066 4016 digitally controlled switch i suggest looking at a 555 oscillator chip they cost 1 at radio shack much cheaper in quantity at quality places and you will be able to find good info about simple circuits in a 555 oscialltor notebook i think forest mims has one at radio shack you ll have to toy with resistor capacitor values or you can use your head with a little math to get the right frequencies any engineer worth his salt can make a 555 osciallator it s in the book and left up to you to see i hate doing ascii circuit graphics the 555 can accurately go from a few hz to about 500 khz i think about the tape recorder gizmo you could alter a stereo tape deck to use one channel as a data line for flashing led and one as audio line for voice or music this would eliminate a lot of noise the data line is probably most easily done by some kind of pll or bandpass filter using just an op amp the 565 chip is a good pll and not hard to work with however if you nothing about how a pll works i suggest you don t try this op amp information can also be found in the forest mims radio shack info booklets and the popular 741 op amp is a snap to work with setting frequency and bandpass filter values are not so easy so i would suggest the 555 method firstmost i have no idea what this is going into so i am really generalizing as for manufacturing techniques if you re only goofing with it i suggest you breadboard the thing no need to solder wire wrap would be the next more permanent step and lastly soldering pcb making hope that clears things

space center in the kazakhstan republic aboard those boosters were a new breed of venera probe for the planet venus designated venera 15 and 16 the probes were meant not for landing yet more spherical craft on the venerean surface but to radar map the planet in detail from orbit to accomplish this task the basic venera design was modified in numerous areas the central bus core was made one meter 39 37 inches longer to carry the two tons of propellant required for braking into orbit double the fuel carried by the venera 9 and 10 orbiters eight years earlier extra solar panels were added on to give the vehicles more power for handling the large amounts of data which would be created by the radar imaging the dish shaped communications antennae were also made one meter larger to properly transmit this information to earth atop the buses where landers were usually placed were installed the 1 4 by 6 meter 4 62 by 19 8 foot 300 kilogram 660 pound polyus v side looking radar antennae the radar system possibly a terrain imaging version of the nuclear powered satellites used by the soviets for earth ocean surveillance would be able to map venus surface at a resolution of one to two kilometers 0 62 to 1 2 miles the soviet probes imaging parameters were a vast improvement over the united states pioneer venus orbiter which could reveal objects no smaller than 75 kilometers 45 miles in diameter and while the veneras resolution was comparable to that of similar observations made by the 300 meter 1 000 foot arecibo radio telescope on the island of puerto rico the orbiters would be examining the northern pole of venus this region was unobtainable by either arecibo or pioneer venus and appeared to contain a number of potentially interesting geological features worthy of investigation on october 10 1983 after an interplanetary journey of 330 million kilometers 198 million miles and two mid course corrections venera 15 fired its braking rockets over venus to place itself in a polar orbit 1 000 by 65 000 kilometers 600 by 39 000 miles around the planet completing one revolution every twenty four hours venera 16 followed suit four days later the twin probes thus became venus first polar circling spacecraft radar operations began on october 16 for venera 15 and october 20 for venera 16 for up to sixteen minutes every orbit over the north pole the probes would make a radar sweep of the surface 150 kilometers ninety miles wide and nine thousand kilometers 5 400 miles long the craft would then head out to the highest part of their orbits over the south pole to recharge their batteries and transmit the data back to two large soviet antennae on earth each strip of information took eight hours to process by computer by the end of their main missions in july of 1984 the veneras had mapped 115 million square kilometers 46 million square miles thirty percent of the entire planet venera 15 and 16 revealed that venus has a surface geology more complex than shown by pioneer venus in the late 1970s numerous hills mountains ridges valleys and plains spread across the landscape many of them apparently formed by lava from erupting volcanoes in the last one billion years in planetary terms this makes the venerean surface rather young hundreds of craters were detected as well the largest of which had to have been created by meteorites planetoids would be a better term here at least fourteen kilometers 8 4 miles across due to venus very dense atmosphere there were some disagreements between u s and soviet scientists on the origins of certain surface features for example the probes owners declared that the 96 kilometer 57 6 mile wide crater at the summit of 10 800 meter 35 640 foot high maxwell montes the tallest mountain on the planet was the result of a meteorite impact american scientists on the other hand felt the crater was proof that maxwell was a huge volcano sitting on the northern continent of ishtar terra in any event the u s decided to wait on making verdicts about venus until the arrival of their own radar probe scheduled for later in the decade originally named the venus orbiting imaging radar voir its initial design was scaled back and the craft was redesig nated the venus radar mapper vrm eventually the machine would be called magellan after the portuguese navigator ferdinand magellan circa 1480 1521 this vehicle would map the entire planet in even finer detail than the veneras for the time however the soviet probes maintained that distinction radar imaging was not the only ability of the veneras bolted next to the polyus v radar antenna were the omega altimeter and the fourier infrared spectrometer the latter for measuring the world s temperatures the majority of the areas covered registered about five hundred degrees celsius 932 degrees fahrenheit but a few locations were two hundred degrees hotter possibly indicating current volcanic activity the probes also found that the clouds over the poles were five to eight kilometers three to 4 8 miles lower than at the equator in contrast the polar air above sixty kilometers thirty six miles altitude was five to twenty degrees warmer than the equatorial atmosphere at similar heights when the main mapping mission ended in july of 1984 there were plans for at least one of the veneras to radar image the surface at more southernly latitudes unfortunately this idea did not come to pass as the orbiters may not have possessed enough attitude control gas to perform the operation venera 15 and 16 ceased transmission in march of 1985 leaving the soviet institute of radiotechnology and electronics with six hundred kilometers 360 miles of radar data tape to sort into an atlas of twenty seven maps of the northern hemisphere of venus venus by balloon for years the thick atmosphere of venus had been a tempting target to scientists who wished to explore the planet s mantle of air with balloon borne instruments professor jacques blamont of the french space agency centre national d etudes spatiales cnes had proposed such an idea as far back as 1967 only to have a joint french soviet balloon mission canceled in 1982 nevertheless late in the year 1984 such dreams would eventually come true when two proton rockets were sent skyward on december 15 and 21 the soviet union provided western observers with the first clear full views of the booster which had been launching every soviet venus probe since 1975 this was but one of many firsts for the complex mission the unmanned probes launched into space that december were named vega 1 and 2 a contraction of the words venera and gallei gallei being the russian word for halley not only did the spacecraft have more than one mission to perform they also had more than one celestial objective to explore namely the comet halley this famous periodic traveler was making its latest return to the inner regions of the solar system since its last visit in 1910 since it was widely believed that comets are the icy remains from the formation of the solar system five billion years ago scientists around the world gave high priority to exploring one of the few such bodies which actually come close to earth most comets linger in the cold and dark outer fringes of the solar system some like halley are perturbed by various forces and fall in towards the sun where they circle for millennia spewing out ice and debris for millions of kilometers from the warmth of each solar encounter the soviet union along with the european space agency esa and japan s institute of space and astronautical science isas did not wish to miss out on this first opportunity in human history to make a close examination of halley the esa would be using the cylindrical giotto probe to make a dangerously close photographic flyby of the comet while japan s first deep space craft sakigake pioneer and suisei comet would view halley from a much safer distance scientists in the united states also desired to study the comet from the vantage of a space probe at one time envisioning a vessel powered by solar sails or ion engines however government budget cuts to nasa canceled the american efforts the u s would have to make do primarily with earth based observations and the sharing of data from other nations though an instrument named the dust counter and mass analyzer ducma designed by chicago university professor john simpson was added on the soviet mission in may of 1984 the soviets answer to halley were the vegas instead of building an entirely new craft for the mission the soviets decided to modify their venera bus design to encounter the comet while performing an advanced venus mission along the way as vega 1 and 2 reached venus the buses would drop off one lander balloon each and use the mass of the shrouded planet to swing them towards comet halley much as the u s probe mariner 10 used venus to flyby mercury eleven years earlier the soviet craft would then head on to halley helping to pinpoint the location of the comet s erupting nucleus for the giotto probe to dive in only 605 kilometers 363 miles away in march of 1986 as planned the two vegas arrived at venus in june of 1985 vega 1 released its payload first on the ninth day of the month the lander making a two day descent towards the planet the craft touched the upper atmosphere on the morning of june 11 sixty one kilometers 36 6 miles above the venerean surface a small container was released by the lander which produced a parachute at 55 kilometers 33 miles altitude thus the first balloon probe ever to explore venus had successfully arrived one kilometer after the opening of the parachute helium gas was pumped into the teflon coated plastic balloon inflating it to a diameter of 3 54 meters 11 68 feet dangling on a tether thirteen meters 42 9 feet below was the instrument package properly known as an aerostat the top part of the 6 9 kilogram 15 18 pound aerostat consisted of a cone which served as an antenna and tether attachment point to the balloon beneath it was the transmitter electronics and instruments connected at the bottom was a nephelometer for measuring cloud particles the aerostat was painted with a special white finish to keep at bay the corroding mist of sulfuric acid which permeated the planet s atmosphere the vega 1 balloon was dropped into the night side of venus just north of the equator scientists were concerned that the gas bag would burst in the heat of daylight so they placed it in the darkened hemisphere to give the craft as much time as possible to return data this action necessitated that the landers come down in the dark as well effectively removing the camera systems used on previous missions the author wonders though if they could have used floodlights similar to the ones attached to venera 9 and 10 in 1975 when soviet scientists had thought the planet s surface was enshrouded in a perpetual twilight due to the permanently thick cloud cover the first balloon transmitted for 46 5 hours right into the day hemisphere before its lithium batteries failed covering 11 600 kilometers 6 960 miles the threat of bursting in the day heat did not materialize the vega 1 balloon was stationed at a 54 kilometer 32 4 mile altitude after dropping ballast at fifty kilometers thirty miles for this was considered the most active of the three main cloud layers reported by pioneer venus in 1978 indeed the balloon was pushed across the planet at speeds up to 250 kilometers 150 miles per hour strong vertical winds bobbed the craft up and down two to three hundred meters 660 to 990 feet through most of the journey the layer s air temperature averaged forty degrees celsius 104 degrees fahrenheit and pressure was a mere 0 5 earth atmosphere the nephelometer could find no clear regions in the surrounding clouds early in the first balloon s flight the vega 1 lander was already headed towards the venerean surface both landers were equipped with a soil drill and analyzer similar to the ones carried on venera 13 and 14 in 1982 however vega 1 would become unable to report the composition of the ground at its landing site in rusalka planitia the mermaid plain north of aphrodite terra while still ten to fifteen minutes away from landing a timer malfunction caused the drill to accidentally begin its programmed activity sixteen kilometers 9 6 miles above the surface there was neither any way to shut off the instrument before touchdown nor reactivate it after landing this was unfortunate not only for the general loss of data but also for the fact that most of venus was covered with such smooth low level lava plains and had never before been directly examined nevertheless the surface temperature and pressure was calculated at 468 degrees celsius 874 4 degrees fahrenheit and 95 earth atmospheres respectively during the lander s 56 minutes of ground transmissions a large amount of background infrared radiation was also recorded at the site as had been done when the drills and cameras on venera 11 and 12 had failed in december of 1978 the soviets focused on the data returned during the lander s plunge through the atmosphere the french soviet malachite mass spectrometer detected sulfur chlorine and possibly phosphorus it is the sulfur possibly from active volcanoes which gives the venerean clouds their yellowish color the sigma 3 gas chromatograph found that every cubic meter of air between an altitude of 48 and 63 kilometers 28 8 and 37 8 miles contained one milligram 0 015 grain of sulfuric acid the vega 1 data on the overall structure of the cloud decks appeared to be at odds with the information from pioneer venus the case was made even stronger by the fact that vega 2 s results nearly matched its twin the vegas found only two main cloud layers instead of the three reported by the u s probes the layers were three to five kilometers 1 8 to 3 miles thick at altitudes of 50 and 58 kilometers 30 and 34 8 miles the clouds persisted like a thin fog until clearing at an altitude of 35 kilometers 21 miles much lower than the pv readings one possibility for the discrepan cies may have been radical structural changes in the venerean air over the last seven years when the lander and balloon finally went silent the last functioning part of the vega 1 mission the flyby bus sailed on for a 708 million kilometer 424 8 million mile journey around the sun to become the first probe to meet comet halley on march 6 1986 the bus made a 8 890 kilometer 5 334 mile pass at the dark and icy visitor before traveling on in interplanetary space the soviets had accomplished their first mission to two celestial bodies with one space vessel on june 13 vega 2 released its lander balloon payload for a two day fall towards venus like its duplicate the vega 2 balloon radioed information back to the twenty antennae tracking it on earth for 46 5 hours before battery failure on the morning side of the planet during its 11 100 kilometer 6 660 mile flight over venus the second balloon entered in a rather still environment which became less so twenty hours into the mission after 33 hours mission time the air became even more turbulent for a further eight hours when the balloon passed over a five kilometer three mile mountain on the continent of aphrodite terra a powerful downdraft pulled the craft 2 5 kilometers 1 5 miles towards the surface temperature sensors on the vega 2 balloon reported that the air layer it was moving through was consistently 6 5 degrees celsius 43 7 degrees fahrenheit cooler than the area explored by the vega 1 balloon this was corroborated by the vega 2 lander as it passed through the balloon s level no positive indications of lightning were made by either balloon and the second aerostat s nephelometer failed to function the vega 2 lander touched down on the northern edge of aphrodite terra s western arm on the fifteenth of june 1 500 kilometers 900 miles southeast of vega 1 the lander s resting place was smoother than thought indicating either a very ancient and worn surface or a relatively young one covered in fresh lava the soil drill was in working order and reported a rock type known as anorthosite troctolite rare on earth but present in luna s highlands this rock is rich in aluminum and silicon but lacking in iron and magnesium a high degree of sulfur was also present in the soil the air around vega 2 measured 463 degrees celsius 865 4 degrees fahrenheit and 91 earth atmospheres essentially a typical day or night on venus far above the vega 2 lander its carrier bus sped past venus at a distance of 24 500 kilometers 14 700 miles and followed its twin to comet halley making a closer flyby on march 9 1986 at just 8 030 kilometers 4 818 miles both probes helped to reveal that the comet is a very dark and irregular shaped mass about fourteen kilometers 8 4 miles across rotating once every 53 hours give or take three hours since both vega craft were still functioning after their halley encounters soviet scientists considered an option to send the probes to other celestial objects one prime target was the near earth planetoid 2101 adonis which vega 2 could pass at a distance of six million kilometers 3 6 million miles sadly the soviets had to back out on the opportunity to become the first nation to fly a spacecraft past a planetoid when it was discovered that there was not enough maneuvering fuel in the probe to reach adonis as planned vega 1 and 2 were quietly shut down in early 1987 future plans diverted the impressive vega mission had given some scientists numerous ideas and hope for even more ambitious expeditions to the second world from the sun one example was the vesta mission planned for the early 1990s this soviet french collaboration called for the launch of multiple probes on a single proton rocket in either 1991 or 1992 the craft would first swing by venus and drop off several landers and balloon probes the aerostats would be designed to survive in the planet s corrosive atmosphere for up to one month a large improvement over the vega balloons two days the mission would then head out to investigate several planetoids and comets including a possible landing on vesta thus the mission name the most reflective main belt planetoid as seen from earth unfortunately for venus exploration plans began to change in the soviet union in 1986 the soviets decided to reroute the vesta mission to the red planet mars instead of venus keeping the comet and planetoid aspects intact by this time in the soviet space program interest was focusing on mars already under construction was an entirely new probe design called phobos two members of this class were planned to leave earth in 1988 and orbit mars the next year phobos 1 and 2 would then place the first instruments on mars largest moon phobos all this was a prelude to even more advanced mars expeditions including balloon probes rovers soil sample return craft and eventually human explorers in the early twenty first century the environment of venus was just too hostile for any serious consideration of human colonization in the near future but things began to look bleak for soviet venus and mars exploration both phobos probes failed to complete their missions one losing contact on the way to the red planet in 1988 and the other going silent in mars orbit just one week before the planned moon landing in march of 1989 in 1989 a plan was devised for a venus orbiter to drop eight to ten penetrators around the planet in 1998 several years later the mission launch date was moved to the year 2005 and has now been put on indefinite hold no other official soviet missions to venus have since been put forth a sad commentary after twenty five years of continuous robotic exploration of the planet during the late 1980s a drastic political and economic change was taking over the soviet union president mikhail gorbachev began to open up his nation to the benefits of increased cooperation with the rest of the nations particularly those in the west while the culture became less oppressive than in the past the economy was taking a very rough ride as it also underwent the effects of a free market these effects hit everywhere including the space program missions at all levels were cut back the soviets began making almost desperate attempts to cooperate with other space faring nations either to keep their remaining programs alive or just to make money in early 1992 it was reported that the soviets were offering for sale several fully equipped veneras they had in storage for the price of 1 6 million dollars each an incredibly low price for any planetary probe no nation took them up on the bargain meanwhile the united states was gearing up for new venus missions of their own magellan and galileo the u s reactivated their long dormant planetary exploration with the launch of the space shuttle atlantis on may 4 1989 aboard the shuttle was the magellan spacecraft a combination of spare parts from other u s probes designed to make the most detailed and complete radar mapping of venus in history when magellan reached the second world in august of 1990 it would be able to map almost the entire planet down to a resolution of 108 meters 360 feet surpassing the abilities of venera 15 and 16 in the interim another american probe was launched from a space shuttle which would make a quick flyby of venus on its way to orbit the giant planet jupiter in 1995 on october 18 1989 the shuttle atlantis released its second unmanned planetary probe into space named galileo after the famous italian astronomer who discovered the probe s primary target s major moons in 1610 in the absence of a powerful enough booster to send galileo on a direct flight to the jovian planet the probe was sent around venus and earth several times to build up enough speed to reach jupiter as a result venus became galileo s first planetary goal in february of 1990 the probe radioed back images of the planet s swirling clouds and further indications of lightning in that violent atmosphere on the drawing boards with the incredible success of magellan in the last few years new plans have been laid out for further journeys to venus scien tists in the u s have talked to space scientists in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent states since january 1 1992 of a cooperative effort to launch new venera lander missions within in the next decade japan india and the esa have also considered their own venus missions in the next few decades in february of 1993 nasa came up with several new venus projects as part of their discovery program for launching inexpensive probes throughout the solar system for venus two missions were selected for further study a venus multiprobe mission involving the landing of fourteen small probes over one hemisphere to measure winds air temperature and pressure and the venus composition probe designed to study venus atmosphere while descending through the thick air with the aid of a parachute much as the soviets had done since 1967 final project decisions will be made in 1994 humans on venus will a human ever be able to stand on the surface of venus at present the lead melting temperatures and crushing air pressure would be threatening to any earth life not protected in something even tougher than a venera lander plans have been looked into changing the environment of venus itself into something more like earth s however it should be noted that any such undertaking will require the removal of much of the thick carbon dioxide atmosphere a major reduction in surface heat and the ability to speed up the planet s rotation rate to something a bit faster than once every 243 earth days such a project may take centuries if not millennia in the meantime efforts should be made to better understand venus as its exists today we still have yet to fully know how a world so seemingly similar to earth in many important ways became instead such a deadly place will earth ever suffer this fate perhaps venus holds the answers such answers may best be found through international cooperation including the nation which made the first attempts to lift the cloudy veils from venus

2 | i have a fairly severe high frequency hearing loss a recent rough test showed a gently sloping loss to 10 20db down at 1000cps then it falls off a cliff to 70 80dbs down from 1500cps on this type of loss is difficult to fit i am currently using some old siemens behind the ear aids which keep me roughly functional but leave a lot to be desired recently i had an opportunity to test the widex q8 behind the ear aids for several weeks these have four independent programs which are intended to be customized for different hearing situations and can be reprogramed i found them to be a definite improvement over my current aids and was about to go ahead with them until another local outfit advertised a free trial of another programmable system called resound unfortunately i was only able to try the resound aids in their office for about 30 minutes and i couldn t compare them head to head with the widex nevertheless it did appear to me that they were superior and i was impressed by what i was able to read about the theory behind them which i will give in a separate posting they also carry the widex aids and had one patient presumably wealthy who decided to go ahead and get the resound even though he had purchased the widex only 6 months ago the problem is that the resound aids are about twice as expensive as the widex and other programmable aids i could take a trip to europe on the difference being a lover of bargains and hating to spend money i am having a hard time persuading myself to go with the resounds i would appreciate any opinions on this and other hearing aids and projections about when and if i might see improvements in technology that aren t quite so expensive

3 | okay the earth has a magnetic field unless someone missed something okay if you put a object in the earth magnetic field it produces electricty now the question can you use electricity to power a space low earth orbit vehicle and i fyou can can you use the magnetic field of the earth to power it can the idea of a dragless satellite be used in part to create the electrical field after all the dragless satellite is i might be wrong a suspended between to pilons the the pilons compensate for drag i think i know what i want to say just not sure how to say it a dragless satellite sounds interestingly enough liek a generator michael adams nsmca acad3 alaska edu i m not high just jacked
2 | some of the md s in this newsgroup have been riding my butt pretty good maybe in some cases with good reason in this post on depression i m laying it all out i ll continue to post here because i think that i have some knowledge that could be useful once you have read this post you should know where i m coming from when i post again in the future lida i can emphasize with your situation both my wife and i suffered from bouts of depression her s was brought on by breast cancer and mine was a rebound stress reaction to her modified radical mastectomy and chemotherapy lida i used my knowledge of nutrition to get her through her six months of chemotherapy with the approval of her oncologist when severe depression set in a few months after the chemo stopped i tried to use supplements to bring her out of it i had cured her pms using supplements and i really thought that i knew enough about the role of diet in depression to take care of her depression as well it didn t work and she was put on prozac by her oncologist two winters ago three years after by wife s breast cancer i got hit with severe depression pretty typical and one reason why many marriages break up after breast cancer or another stressor i tried to take care of it for several months with supplementation didn t work my internist ended up putting me on prozac i was going to give you a list of several studies that have been done using b6 niacin folate and b12 to cure depression i m not going to do that because all you would be doing is flying blind like i was lida i do believe that depression can have a dietary component but the problem is that you need to know exactly what the problem is and then use an approach which will fix the problem for chemotherapy i knew exactly what drugs were going to be used and exactly what nutrients would be affected same thing for pms i was flying blind for both of these stressors but the literature that i used to devise a treatment program was pretty good depression is just too complicated what you really need is a nutritional scan this is not a diet analysis but an analysis of your bodies nutrient reserves for every vitamin and mineral except vitamin c you have a reserve the rda is not designed to give you enough of any nutrient to keep these reserves full it is only designed to keep them from being emptied which would cause clinical pathology stress will increase your need for many vitamins and minerals this is when your reserves become very important lida without your permission i m going to use your post as a conduit to try to explain to the readers in this group and sci med where i m coming from i have taught a course on human nutrition in one of the osteopathic medical schools for ten years now i ve written my own textbook because none was available what i teach is not a rehash of biochemistry i preach nutrient reserves yes my lectures in this course are referred to by my students as sermons here is what i cover indroduction and carbohydrates lipids proteins i proteins ii energy balance evaluation of nutritional status i a clinical perspective evaluation of nutritional status ii evaluation of nutritional a biochemical perspective status iii homework assignment using the nutritionist iv diet and fitness analysis software program weight control food fads and facts age related change in nutrient requirements food additives contaminants and cancer drug nutrient interactions mineral and water balance sodium potassium and chloride calcium magnesium and phosphorus iron zinc and copper iodine and fluoride other trace minerals vitamin a vitamin e vitamins d and k vitamin c thiamin and niacin riboflavin and pyridoxine pantothenic and folic acids biotin and b12 other nutrient factors enteral nutrition parenteral nutrition every three years i spend my entire summer reviewing the medical literature to find material that i can use in my nutrition textbook i last did this in the summer of 1991 i read everything that i can find and then sit down and rewrite my lecture handouts which are bound in three separate books that have 217 237 and 122 pages opposite each page of written text which i write myself i ve pulled figures tables and graphs from various copyrighted sources since this material is only being used for educational purposes i can get around the copyright laws so far i can not send this material out to newsgroup readers as i ve been asked to do i am now in the process of trying to get a grant to setup a nutrition assessment lab this is the last peice of the nutrition puzzle that i need to make my education program complete this lab will let me measure the nutrient reserve for almost all the vitamins and minerals that are known to be required in humans the mayo clinic already uses a similiar lab to design supplement programs for their cancer patients cancer treatment centers of america which is a private for profit organization with hospitals in illinois and oklahoma tulsa also operates a nutritional assessment clinical lab i also believe that the pritikin clinic in california has a similiar lab setup for physicians reading this post i would suggest that you get the new clinical nutrition textbook that has just been published feb by mosby i have been using alpers manual of nutritional therapeutics a little brown series book as a supplemental text for my course but alpers is geared more to residency training two m d s have written this new clinical nutrition textbook and it is geared more towards medical student education and it does a good job of covering the lab tests that can be run to assess a patient s nutritional status let me quote a few sentences from the preface of this new text so called nutrition specialists were in reality gastroenterologists hematologists or pediatricians who just happened to profess some knowledge of nutrition as it related to their field of practice unfortunately about two thirds of the medical schools in the united states require no formal instruction in nutrition but times and medical practice have changed more than half of the leading causes of death in this country are nutrition related this monograph should accomplish the following two objectives 1 it should complement your medical training by emphasizing the relevance of nutrition to your medical practice and 2 it should heighten your awareness of nutrition as a medical speciality that is vitally important for both disease prevention and the treatment of diseases of essentially every organ system roland l weinsier md drph lida my advise to you is that you tell your family members to try to find a physician who has an understanding of the role that vitamins and minerals yes even magnesium may play a role in depression play in depression and who could get a nutritional profile run menopause is often a time when women suffer depression there are a lot of hormonal changes that are occuring but they are not the same ones that occur during pms a nutritionist may also be able to help not too long ago a poster mentioned that his nutritionist had diagnosed a selenium deficiency based on a red cell glutathionine peroxidase test the specific test for the selenium reserve most clinical labs will not run this test and i advised him to try to make sure that the lab that did the test was certified there are also a lot of hair and nail analysis labs setup to do trace mineral analysis but these labs are not regulated checks of these labs using certified standards and also those doing water lead analysis showed some pretty shoddy testing was going on if you or anyone else finds someone who will run these speciality nutrition tests make sure that they are using a lab that has been certified under clia the clinical laboratory improvement act a diet analysis may be helpful since many nutrient reserves have been shown to correlate fairly well with the dietary intake as monitored by food logging and software analysis nutritionist iv and other software programs but there are still about half of the nutrients required by humans that do not show a very good correlation between apparent dietary intake and reserve status until we have more nutritional assessment clinical labs in operation in the u s and physicians who have been trained how to use the nutritional profile that these labs provide to devise a treatment approach that uses diet changes and supplementation anti depressants will probably continue to be the best approach to depression martin banschbach ph d professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and microbiology osu college of osteopathic medicine

1 | there are a number of inaccuracies here 1 in fact a colder battery will self discharge more slowly this is why batteries should be stored in a cool dry place 2 an battery placed on concrete does not become colder than one placed on wood the battery the wood and the concrete will all be at the same general temperature ignoring temperature fluctuations and thus none will effect the other there is no need to exercise the battery just keep it charged a trickle charger will do the job

2 | actually i am entering vet school next year but the question is relevant for med students too memorizing large amounts has never been my strong point academically since this is a major portion of medical education anatomy histology pathology pharmacology are for the most part mass memorization i am a little concerned as i am sure most med students are can anyone suggest techniques for this type of memorization i have had reasonable success with nemonics and memory tricks like thinking up little stories to associate unrelated things but i have never applied them to large amounts of data has anyone had luck with any particular books memory systems or cheap software can you suggest any helpful organizational techniques being an older student who returned to school this year organization another one of my weak points has been a major help to my success please no griping about how all you have to do is learn the material conceptually i have no problem with that it is one of my strong points but you can t get around the fact that much of medicine is rote memorization

3 | introducing the back to the moon in congress the next step the next key hurdle for the lunar resources data purchase act is introduction of the act in congress at this point many congresspersons have been approached about the bill however for a successful effort to pass the bill we need the best possible congressperson to introduce the bill due to his position as chair of the house committee on space and science congressman george brown is the logical choice he has a long record of support and interest in space development and helped pass the launch services purchase act and the space settlements act there is a small group of activists in southern california who have assisted george brown in his recent re election campaigns we are mobilizing this group to have them tell congressman brown about the back to the moon bill we are also asking pro space constituents to let him know that they care about getting america back to the moon finally there is a good chance that a nationwide alert for space activists to call or write george brown to have him introduce the back to the moon bill may be staged during late spring 1993 all this should produce a positive reaction from brown s office as more is known it will be passed on however even if we are successful in getting him to support the bill this alone will not ensure passage of the bill for any bill to become law one of three conditions must exist either the bill must reflect widespread national support for an issue such as extension of unemployment insurance benefits be propelled by high priced lobbyists we re out of luck there or have widespread support within congress due to small but widespread constituent support the latter is the path that we by necessity must choose this means that the introduction of the lunar resources data purchase act must be immediately accompanied by a large number of congresspersons sponsorship of the bill to accomplish this we need activists to ask their congressperson to support the lunar resources data purchase act now to wait until the bill is introduced is simply too late it takes time to have a congressperson s staff review a bill if your congressperson mentions that the bill is not yet introduced please elicit their opinion of the bill as currently written we appreciate all comments on the bill from activists and politicians if you have yet to see the back to the moon bill please request a copy by email please include your u s postal service address or contact your local chapter of the national space society
2 | there are several different types of thyroid diseases which would cause a hypothyroid condition reduction in the output of the thyroid mainly thyroxin except for ones caused by infections the treatment is generally thyroxin pills hypothyroid conditions caused by infections usually disappear when the infection does this doesn t sound like the case with your wife thyroxin orally does shut down the thyroid through a feedback loop involving the pituitary i believe the pituitary thinks that the correct amount of thyroxin is being produced so it doesn t have to tell the thyroid to produce more this process is reversable i have hashimoto s thyroiditis an autoimmune condition and was on thyroxin for approx 6 mo when my endocrinologist suggested i not take the pills for 6 wks when i was retested for thyroxin levels they were normal i still get tested every 6mo because the condition might reappear the pills are safe and have very few side affects those mostly at beginning of treatment having a baby might be a problem and would at least require closer monitoring of hormone levels thyroxin controls energy production which explains sleepiness coldness and weight gain there is also water retention possibly around heart changes in vision and coarser hair and skin among other things i am not a doctor so i m sure i mistated something but the important thing is that thyroid problems are usually easily corrected and if they aren t corrected can cause problems in the rest of the body get a second opinion from a good endocrinologist and have him her explain things in detail to you and your wife

3 | sci space readers can skip the first paragraph yesterday in response to henry spencer s question about the temperature of a blackbody in interstellar space i said dust grains acts as blackbodies and they re at 40 150 k well i was dead wrong our local interstellar dust expert bruce draine has informed me that dust grains _aren t_ good radiators in the far ir which is why they are so warm actually the ambient radiation field from distant stars can bring a true blackbody to only 3 or 4 kelvin sorry henry and anyone else i misled obviously time for me to take another ism class in other news alan stern of the southwest research institute gave a talk on the pluto charon binary system yesterday he gave a brief overview of the currently accepted system parameters volume ratio of about 8 1 mass ratio about 15 1 or so plus lots more and then gave his thoughts on the formation of pluto charon his idea is that there were lots and lots of small planetesimals in the outer solar system with masses distributed as a power law of some kind over time the planetesimals accreted into larger bodies most got scattered out of the solar system by close encounters with jupiter and saturn but many accreted into the gas giants especially uranus and neptune a large planetesimal was captured by neptune we call it triton captured how perhaps by a collision with a smaller already existing neptunian moon perhaps by a very close passage through neptune s atmosphere mondo aerobraking he notes that the two recently discovered kuiper belt objects 1992 qb1 and 1993 fw plus chiron and pholus are all about the same mass and he identifies this group as one accretion down from the larger bodies of triton and pluto charon pluto charon he thinks formed when an impacting body hit proto pluto knocking some material into a ring around pluto which later accreted in charon similar to ideas about the formation of earth s moon there is good evidence from spectra that the surfaces of pluto and charon are very different pluto has methane frost charon doesn t which can be used as evidence for the impact theory he believes that there may be around 1000 pluto to chiron sized objects remaining in a relatively stable dynamical zone just outside neptune s orbit beyond 35 au or so 1992 qb1 and 1993 fw are the first members of this population to be found in his model note that such bodies will be very dark since if their surfaces are covered with methane frost it will have photolyzed into very dark long chain hydrocarbons by now the reason that pluto has such a high albedo around 0 5 i think is that its surface warms up just enough around perihelion to sublimate and when the atmosphere freezes out again thirty years later it forms bright new frost so any bodies much farther away than 30 au are going to be very hard to see i hope i haven t made any errors in the transcription if you see a howling mistake it s undoubtedly mine not his by the way he s one of the top guns behind the pluto fast flyby mission i think and said that the current plans are to use a titan 4 to send the probe on just about a rectilinear trajectory to pluto we were speaking loosely at the time he d like to use a proton which gives a slightly smaller velocity but costs much less his figures 500 million for 2 titan 4 launches there will be two separate probes launched separately or 120 million for 2 proton launches he told a story about how the soviets originally offered to sell proton launches for 30 million each but were forced to increase their prices in the us in order to be allowed in the marketplace i m just telling you what he said michael

2 | yup the demonstration to which you refer consists of placing a leaf between the plates and taking a kirlian photograph of it you then cut off part of the leaf put the top plate back on and take another kirlian photograph you see pretty much the same image in both cases turns out the effect isn t nearly so striking if you take the trouble to clean the plates between photographs seems that the moisture from the leaf that you left on the place conducts electricity surprise surprise this is true but it s not quite the whole story there were actually some people who were more careful in their methodology who also replicated the phantom leaf effect you can also replicate the effect with a rock take your first kirlian photograph then moisten one edge of the rock lo and behold phantom rock carl j lydick internet carl sol1 gps caltech edu nsi hepnet sol1 carl

1 | actually no i don t have a tape drive in the event of a total hard disk failure i reinstall the apps from originals and restore the data from the backups i keep of that with upwards of 100mb of stuff on my hard disk there is no way i m going to try and back it all up without a tape drive would be nice to have one though maybe maybe not today it doesn t happen as often i would hope but then if a bios is buggy and the user gets an upgrade the bios information is going to change at least the date anyway tagging the bios manufacturer is still going to falsely tag those users who upgrade the motherboard this type of upgrade doesn t require a hard disk backup restore as long as it wasn t done too terribly often otherwise i think it would get annoying and the user would go looking for other software of course not if something gets corrupted and my app needs to be reinstalled the worst thing i want that software telling me is this software has already been registered to blank and it is against the law to install it on other machines or something similar access for windows does this and it only requires a click on ok to go away pretty non intrusive but it gets the point across this is a great idea i like the key system that some shareware products use the only problem is that it will be difficult for big software companies to implement this without it getting very cost ineffective for them and more of a burden than a benefit to the users steve madsen sjmadsen nextsrv cas muohio edu
2 | david this study looks like a good one gordon rubenfeld did a medline search and also sent me the same reference through e mail since commercial yogurt does not always have a good lactobacillus a or bulgaricus culture a negative finding would not have been too informative this is often the reason why lactobacillus acidophilus tablets are recommended rather than yogurt i guess the next question is why would this introduction of good bacteria back into the gut decrease the incidence of vaginal candida blooms if the anus was not serving as a candida reservoir a fact that gordon r vehementy denys i see two possible theories one the l acidophilus which is a facultatively anaerobic bacterium could make it through the gut and colonize the rectal area to overgrow the candida this would not explain the reoccurance of candida blooms in the vagina after the yogurt ingestion was stopped though the other is that the additional bacteria in the intestinal tract remove most of the glucose from the feces and candida looses it s major food source getting lactobacillus acidophilus to colonize the vaginal tract where it is normally found would have a much better effect on the recurrance of vaginal yeast blooms though an acetic acid lactobacillus acidophilus douche has been used to get this effect but i ve not seen any such treatment reported in the medical literature this would be an example of physicians conducting their own clinical trials to try to come up with treatments that help their patients when this is done in private practice the results are rarely if ever published it was the hallmark of medicine until the modern age emerged with clinical trials it really raises a big question does the medical profession cast out the adventerous few who try new treatments to help patients or does it look the other way this particular issue is really a very simple one since no real dangerous therapy is involved even the anti fungals are not all that dangerous but there are some areas like edta chelation therapy where the fire is pretty hot and somebody could get burned it s really tough do i follow only well established protocols and then give up if they don t work that well or do it try something that looks like it will work but hasn t been proven to work yet my stand is to consider other treatment possibilities especially if they involve little or no risk to the patient getting good bacteria back into the gut after antibiotic treatment is one treatment possibility the other is getting l acidophilus into the vaginal tract of a woman who is having a problem with recurring yeast infections

3 | people who criticize big government and its projects rarely seem to have a consistent view of the role of government in science and technology basically the u s government has gotten into the role of supporting research which private industry finds too expensive or too long term historically this role for the u s gov t was forced upon it because of socialism in other countries in order for u s industries to compete with government subsidized foreign competitors the u s gov t has taken on the role of subisizing big ticket or long lead r d as a republican i abhor the necessity for our government to involve itself in technology this way i believe that market forces should drive technology and the world would be a better place for it but the whole world would have to implement this concept simultaneously or some countries would have subsidized r d while others would not so the u s must subsidize because everybody else does this sounds a lot like the farm subsidies arguments behind our gatt negotiations doesn t it but this role of government subsidies is antithetical to cost effectiveness the general idea is to spend money on new technology and thereby maintain and promote our technological culture despite the forces in the business world like the dreaded quarterly earnings report which erode the ability of u s industry to invest in new technology and since our goal is to spend money it makes little sense to try to save money of course we could always spend our money more wisely but everybody disagrees about that the wisdom should be it s interesting to note that some of our best tools for cost control available in industry today were derived from government projects gantt charts cp m and most of the modern scheduling software comes from dod projects and their contractors the construction industry has taken these tools to the core of their businesses every large construction project now uses these tools ken jenks nasa jsc gm2 space shuttle program office kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov 713 483 4368

2 | if i prescribe itraconazole for a patient s sinusitis neither the ama fda state licensing board nor abfp will be knocking on my door to ask why this is a specious argument among other things how to evaluate new theories and treatments funny i thought it meant one who fraudulently misrepresents his ability and experience in the diagnosis and treatment of disease or the effects to be achieved by the treatment he offers dorland s 27th certainly more precision than conveyed by chronic yeast the inability to discriminate between fraudulent or erroneous representations is far more frightening it is fraud to promote a treatment where the evidence for it is either lacking or against it and the quacksalver knows so or error if the honest practitioner doesn t know so failure to speak out against either bespeaks incompetency may i reply seriously that if the practitioners and proponents of non scientific medicine have left their minds so open that the parts of their brains that do critical evaluation have fallen out they should learn to edit their newsgroup headers to conform to the existing hierarchy and divisions

3 | deleted deleted ok so those scientists can get around the atmosphere with fancy computer algorythims but have you looked ad the hubble results the defects of the mirror are partially correctable with software see those jupiter pictures for results but is the effects are completely reversable why is there going to be a shuttle mission to fix it the way i see it and please astromomers give me a swift net kick in the butt if i m out of the ball park the astromers are making the best of limited possiblities there s only one hubble and the shuttle makes another in the near future a non thought perhaps those self same billboards could have small optical receptors of a limited kind mounted on the reverse sides of the mirror s if that is what is used and then the whole thing becomes a giant array telescope
3 | why not build a inflatable space dock if you re doing large scale satellite servicing being able to do it in a pressurized hangar makes considerable sense the question is whether anyone is going to be doing large scale satellite servicing in the near future to the point of justifying development of such a thing that s a mighty fine idea but since you asked why not i ll respond putting aside the application of such a space dock there are other factors to consider than just pressurized volume temperature control is difficult in space and your inflatable hangar will have to incorporate thermal insulation maybe a double walled inflatable micrometeoroid protection and radiation protection are also required don t think this will be a clear plastic bubble it s more likely to look like a big white ball made out of the same kind of multi layer fabric that soft torso space suits are made out of today because almost all manned space vessels skylab mir salyut used their pressurization for increased structural rigidity even though they had have metal skins they still kind of qualify as inflatable the inflation process would have to be carefully controlled the space environment reduces ductility in exposed materials due to temperature extremes monotomic oxygen impingement and radiation effects on materials so your fabric may not retain any flexibility for long this may not matter even after inflation pressure changes in the hangar may cause flexing in the fabric which could lead to holes and tears as ductility decreases these are some of the technical difficulties which the llnl proposal for an inflatable space station dealt with to varying degrees of success ken jenks nasa jsc gm2 space shuttle program office kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov 713 483 4368

3 | i can t see the need for a single big expensive heavy mothership except for voyager style flyby missions a few years ago i did some calculations on a grand tour space probe launched by a saturn v in 1975 76 at the time i felt that the idea of a big mother ship had some merit the voyagers had to be rather small lightweight craft due to the limitations imposed by using weak titan iii centaur launchers the concept i examined and michael s had a lot in common with the british interplanetary society s daedalus project for sending a probe to barnard s star i e a large bus spacecraft carrying several smaller probes to be dispatched when the ship arrives at its destination the saturn v supposedly would have been able to launch a 10 ton payload towards jupiter and beyond the bus could have included far more powerful cameras telescopes scientific equipment and a heavier more powerful power source than the voyagers as there would be no limitations on weight anymore extremely important as the voyagers had to perform most of their measurements within a couple of weeks before and after planetary encounter and usually at a relatively great distance the smaller probes carried aboard might have been based on the real voyagers and an even smaller version like the one scheduled for launch towards pluto in the early 21st century and would have been released at various points during the mission the advantages are obvious the bus would have carried out the same basic jupiter saturn uranus neptune mission than voyager 2 did but in addition two sub probes could have been relased at saturn examining that planet s south polar regions before moving on to pluto this would have enabled nasa to map both hemispheres of pluto charon by 1986 and several other probes could have examined parts of the jupiter saturn uranus neptune systems that weren t examined in great detail by the voyagers due to trajectory related factors a small swarm of camera equipped miniature space probes released a month before encounter would have been too costly for a small voyager type mission but entirely feasible if launched from a heavy well equipped spacecraft and would we have learned a lot more about the outer planets the reason why the grand tour was cancelled was lack of money of course marcu

1 | pink noise is a random signal with more low frequency components than white noise if you look at the frequency spectrum of white noise at a frequency analyzer you will find that the spectrum power density is flat which means that every frequency is present in the noise signal often pink noise is obtained from white noise by integrating of low pass filtering a white noise signal therefore pink noise contains much more low frequency components the effect of pink noise is sometimes used to simulate thunder or roaring animals an additional low pass filter with variable cutoff frequency will explain you why enjoy it

3 | well i seem to have struck an interesting discussion off given that i am not an astrophysicist or nuclear physicist i ll have to boil it down a bit 1 all the data on bursts to date shows a smooth random distribution 2 that means they aren t concentrated in galactic cores our or someone elses 3 if the distribution is smooth we are either seeing some enormously large phenomena scattered at the edge of the universe said phenomena being subject to debate almost as vioent as the phenomena or we are seeing some phenomena out at like the oort cloud but then it needs some potent little energy source that isn t detectable by any other current methods 4 we know it s not real close like slightly extra solar because we have no parallax measurements on the bursts 5 the bursts seem to bright to be something like black hole quanta or super string impacts or something like that so everyone is watching the data and arguing like mad in the meanwhile what i am wondering is this in people s opinion a new physics problem einstein got well known for solvingthe photoelectric effect copernicus started looking at irregularities in planetary motion is this a big enough problem to create a new area of physics just a little speculative thinking folks

1 | well actually not quite both radar and radio altimeters measure distances by measuring the time required to transmit a signal then receive its reflection from a target radar generally uses pulses while radio altimeters use either pulses or a modulated continuous wave transmission in the case of the latter highly accurate distance measurement can be made as an example the original bendix ala 52 radio altimeter was accurate to 1 8 foot at 2500 feet altitude note however that this is a different method of measuring than the poster originally asked about the problem with gaining accurate measurements between a transmitter and a seperate receiver is that you need a highly accurate time base which starts at the receiver at the exact instant the transmitter triggers this cannot be wire connected since radio waves will actually travel faster in free space air in this case than wire the difference is called the velocity factor of the cable so you need to resort to a common timebase that is automatically corrected for distance etc something like a pll connected to a gps receiver should do the trick triggering both the transmitter and receiver simultaneously sound expensive not too bad but plan on spending a few bucks in both equipment and effort why not go to a different method surveyors use a laser light system where again the reflection time is measured why not try this sounds like something a p e should know about anyway this is actually highly inaccurate since the power output of a transmitter varies from unit to unit there are variances in the antenna and transmission line and the receiver may also vary both from unit to unit and the same unit over time you would need to continuously calibrate the entire system with the radio altimeter this is also done but since everything is located at one place it is much easier to do note especially that the time base for the r a receiver and transmitter is one unit also nope fm capture effect says that the strongest signal wins that is unless the two interfering signals are seperated by more than 3 db in signal strength this is the one problem that makes altimeters inaccurate at very low altitudes signals bouncing off runways tend to be very strong as high as possible to eliminate outside influence and also to enhance attenuation of multipath signals radio altimeters typically use frequencies around 4 ghz hope this helps

3 | i feel compelled to complain the statement that recent observations rule out merging neutron stars as sources of gamma ray bursts is utterly false even though it is popular enough to make it to batse press releases the idea behind the statement is as follows if you smack two neutron stars together or have a neutron star be gobbled up by a black hole a lot of energy is released enough for a gamma ray burst at a cosmological distance but so the reasoning continues this energy is released below a lot of matter so the radiation becomes thermalized and you expect to see roughly a blackbody spectrum the observed spectra are strongly non thermal so this model must be wrong as so often the fault lies with the imagination of the person who was trying to prove the model wrong rather than with the model it may be that the initial energy release is not seen as a gamma ray burst but the fireball of energy and matter that is created may spew out a relativistic flow when this slams into the surrounding medium a strong flux of non thermal gamma rays results which may carry off a substantial fraction of the initial total energy all this is not my idea it is in a series of papers by martin rees peter meszaros sorry for the missing accents and co workers it is certainly not a complete model but it may well be the best one around summing over all proposed distance scales an alternative proposal for what creates the initial fireball by the way is the so called failed supernovae scenario by stan woosley in which a very massive star at the end of its life collapses to a black hole if the stellar core was rotating part of the infalling matter will be temporarily halted because it is supported by centrifugal force and form a very dense neutron torus that accretes onto the black hole this beast may spew out a jet along the rotation axis which again constitutes relativistic flow the rate of such events may be much higher than that of neutron star mergers but the flux may be more strongly beamed so that the net rate of bursts observed on earth stays the same between the two scenarios but the energy released per event can be a lot less in the failed supernova scenario on another note i do believe that the distance scale must ultimately be resolved via some classical astronomical method such as finding counterparts to the bursts at other wavelengths or finding a definitive signature of some known class of objects in the distribution of positions and fluxes theorists have historically not been too successfull in finding the distance of any object by proving that there is only one possible way in which the object can work and therefore it must be so and so

transmission from an hiv positive surgeon to patient is extremely low provided that the surgeon strictly adheres to universal infection control procedures write c fordham von reyn et al of the dartmouth hitchcock medical center in lebanon n h the researchers contacted 2 317 former patients on whom an hiv positive orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures between january 1 1978 and june 30 1992 the orthopedic surgeon voluntarily withdrew from practice after testing positive for hiv a total of 1 174 former patients underwent hiv testing representing 50 7 percent of patients on whom the orthopedic surgeon performed invasive procedures during the 13 5 year period patients were tested from each year and from each category of invasive procedure all patients were found to be negative for hiv by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay two former patients reported known hiv infection prior to surgery the examination of aids case registries and vital records neglected to detect cases of hiv infection among former surgical patients the estimated cost of the initial patient notification and testing was 158 000 with the single most expensive activity being counseling and testing this accounted for 37 percent of the total expense the patient notification and testing were conducted while maintaining the confidentiality of the orthopedic surgeon who was an active participant in the planning and execution of the study notifying patients of the infected surgeon s hiv status is both disruptive and expensive and is not routinely recommended the researchers

number 11 april 25 1993 269 no 14 p 1795 smith rogers audrey et al the risk of hiv transmission during surgery is so remote that it will be quantified only by gathering data from multiple methodologically similar investigations writes audrey smith rogers et al of the johns hopkins university school of medicine in baltimore md the researchers identified a total of 1 131 persons in hospital databases who underwent invasive surgical procedures between 1984 and 1990 and for whom the hiv positive surgeon was listed as the operating surgeon the aids case registries were reviewed for all patients having undergone invasive procedures and death certificates were obtained among the 1 131 patients 101 were dead 119 had no address 413 had test results known and 498 did not respond to the questionnaire no study patient name was found in reported aids case registries one newly detected hiv positive patient was determined to have been most probably infected in 1985 during a transfusion there was no hiv transmission in 369 person hours of surgical exposure suggesting that hiv transmission to patients is unlikely to occur more frequently than once per 1000 person hours of surgical exposure the researchers determined there is no evidence to suggest that the surgeon failed to adhere to standard infection control guidelines over 50 percent of the patients with invasive procedures chose to be tested and of those whose results were revealed only one person was found to be infected with hiv the study patient s infection was probably the result of a tainted blood transfusion received in 1985 as a result there is no evidence that the transmission of hiv from the hiv positive surgeon to any patient transpired the researchers conclude april 20 1993 drug concerns to share aids data new york times 04 20 93 p c10 kolata gina a total of 15 major pharmaceutical companies have decided in a highly unusual move to share aids drugs and information while the drugs are undergoing early clinical testing dr edward scolnick president of the merck research laboratory in rahway n j arranged the collaboration he said that cooperation between companies seemed increasingly significant as it had become clear that combinations of drugs were likely to be more effective in fighting hiv than any drug used alone the researchers are hopeful that hiv when faced with a combination of several drugs requiring mutation at different sites for resistance to develop will be unable to evolve all the mutations at the same time therefore several drugs taken together or one after the other could halt the spread of hiv currently the drug companies do not know what other drugs their competitors are developing the new agreement allows companies to routinely exchange animal data and safety data on new aids drugs an agreement like this will greatly facilitate hicnet medical newsletter page 39 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 companies ability to choose the best drug combinations much faster and in a much more efficient way said scolnick he also said that the collaboration would not violate antitrust laws in creating the agreement merck spoke frequently to members of aids advocacy groups including act up dr daniel hoth director of the division on aids at the national institute of allergy and infectious disease said we re delighted to see the pharmaceutical industry take this step because we think that increasing the information flow will likely accelerate the discovery of better compounds for aids related stories wall street journal 04 20 p b1

of people infected with hiv the findings do not indicate that azt should not be administered in people with full blown aids writes columnist john maddox azt has been used in the united states in asymptomatic hiv positive people on the basis that administration of the drug appeared to abate the decline of t cell counts however a report in the lancet demonstrated that azt should not be used early in the course of disease while the cd4 counts of the 877 people given azt were consistently greater than those of patients receiving only placebo the first three years of follow up have shown that the proportions of people in the two groups progressing to overt aids or even to death were not significantly different at roughly 18 percent the conclusions are that azt is not an effective aids drug in hiv infected individuals and that cd4 cell count may not be a reliable proxy for the progression to aids in infected people but nothing is implied by the study of the utility of azt in the treatment of those in whom symptoms have already appeared there is no case for abandoning that treatment at least on the evidence now available it is much more alarming that the cd4 count has proven to be an unreliable mark of the efficacy of drug treatment in hiv infection aids researchers should acknowledge hiv is alive from the beginning of infection and turn it into a workable assay of the progress of disease the general application of such an assay will probably in itself provide a better understanding of the pathogenesis of aids concludes maddox infective and anti infective properties of breastmilk from hiv 1 infected women lancet 04 10 93 vol 341 no 8850 p 914 van de perre philippe et al a vaccine preparation inducing a persistent immune response of the igm type in the mother s body fluids could be valuable to prevent transmission of hiv 1 from mother to child write philippe van de perre et al of the hicnet medical newsletter page 40 volume 6 number 11 april 25 1993 national aids control program in kigali rwanda the researchers hypothesized that transmission of hiv 1 through breastmilk could be favored by the presence of infected cells by deficiency of anti infective substances in breastmilk or both factors a total of 215 hiv 1 infected women were enrolled at delivery in kigali rwanda milk samples were collected 15 days 6 months and 18 months post partum hiv 1 igg secretory iga and igm were assayed by western blot for the latter two after removal of igg with protein g in the 15 day and 6 month samples the researchers sought viral genome in milk cells by double polymerase chain reaction with three sets of primers gag pol and env at 15 days 6 months and 18 months post partum hiv 1 specific igg was detected in 95 percent 98 percent and 97 percent of breastmilk samples iga in 23 percent 28 percent and 41 percent and igm in 66 percent 78 percent and 41 percent in children who survived longer than 18 months the risk of infection was associated with lack of persistence of igm and iga in their mothers milk the presence of hiv 1 infected cells in the milk 15 days post partum was strongly predictive of hiv 1 infection in the child by both univariate and multivariate analysis the combination of hiv 1 infected cells in breastmilk and a defective igm response was the strongest predictor of infection igm and iga anti hiv 1 in breastmilk may protect against postnatal transmission of hiv the researchers conclude april 21 1993 firms to share aids research in global venture journal of commerce 04 21 93 p 7a a total of fifteen u s and european pharmaceutical companies announced tuesday they will swap drug supplies and information on early stage aids research to hasten the search for combination therapies to fight hiv infection and aids the companies said the unusual move resulted primarily from the increasing concentration of aids research on combination therapies since realizing that hiv is likely to develop resistance to every individual aids drug edward scolnick president of merck co research laboratories led the collaborative effort that took a year of negotiations to come together said participants in addition to merck the other companies involved in the inter company collaboration for aids drug development are bristol myers squibb co burroughs wellcome glaxo inc hoffman la roche eli lilly co pfizer inc smithkline

1 | i have seen the existance of electronics solder with a 2 silver content that seems to have good wetting and fatique reatings can anyone tell me why it is not used silver is not such an expensive metal andy for the most part silver solder is not used for general soldering tasks due to the mechanism of dendritic growth silver solder when exposed to high humidity and placed in an electric field will actually grow dendrites which are conductive and will adventually electrically short across closely spaced nodes which are creating the field for this reason silver is allowed only in hermetically sealed assemblies fortunatly tin lead solder is quite stable and will not grow dendrites as fast as silver solder therefore it is used extensively jerry long

2 | my brother s affine has recently been diagnosed with sweet s syndrome also called steroid resistant sweet s syndrome this syndrome started after she had had iodine 131 treatment for hyperthyroidism she d been reluctant to have treatment for the hyperthyroidism for many years and apparently started to show exaustion from it i understand that she may still be testing high in thyroid level but she s isn t being treated by an endocrinologist her previous endocrinologist bowed out when she entered the hospital she entered the hospital because of the sweet s syndrome symptoms skin lesions i ve looked through the last two years of medline and didn t find an abstract mentioning a correlation between thyroid and sweets i checked a handbook which said that sweet s was associated with leukemia i d like a reccomndation for experts who are in new york city or who travel to new york city for the sweets and perhaps for the endocrinology any information that might help apparently there hasn t been much improvement in her condition over the past several months

2 | a friend was recently admitted to north carolina memorial hospital because of suspected meningitis serious business they wanted to do a lumbar puncture for which a ct scan is a prerequisite i arrived in her hospital room about an hour after she had returned from the ct she was in tears evidently the technicians in the ct lab had been very unpleasant to her to begin with they put her on the apparatus that moves you into the machine itself and just pushed a button to slide her straight into the machine without any explanation imagine this you worried you may have a deadly disease and next thing you know you re being put into this big scary machine without a word of explanation about what is going to happen to you i believe this is inexcusable she waved her hand as if to say what are you doing to me and they responded with annoyance and anger next they inserted or tried to insert an iv catheter apparently she has a lot of trouble with these and complained of the pain the technician just stopped and fixed her with a glare without any words of explanation is there anything i can do about these pigs i realize that these technicians do this sort of job day in and day out and that some patients can be very irritating and uncooperative but this is simply no excuse their purpose for existing is to help sick people and there is no excuse for this sort of behavior fortunately my friend is fine but i imagine a large proportion of the people who get ct scans are not fine at all they have cancer and that sort of thing they don t need this kind of shit also since i named the hospital involved i should also point out that neither she nor i have any complaints about the competence or compassion of any of the other personnel at ncmh

1 | the first step is to make sure that there is no dc component intentional or not on the audio lines to be switched if neither the output or input presents an unintentional dc level let s say they re capacitively coupled then putting a 22 k resistor from each input to ground and from the output to ground is a good precaution against leakage in any coupling caps presenting a dc level that is guaranteed to cause a click if the device presents an unintentional dc level that is from more than just coupling capacitor leakage then you need to remove the dc before switching with coupling capacitors of your own if you have more than one relay each relay switching one input through to a common output you can use make before break switching where for a brief instant both sources are connected during a switch change this may mask the switch click an audio switch that is clickless is made by taking a light bulb and making your own ersatz opto isolator with a light dependent resistor ldr sealed inside a piece of black heatshrink many broadcast consoles use this older but time honored technique claro actually makes a complete optisolator like this but i don t have a part number handy radio shack has a ldr grab bag 276 1657 you might want to try for a simple solid state clickless switch that is cheap you might try looking at the cd4066 analog switch that is commonly available or its older predecessor the 4016 again the dc component must be removed prior to switching other alternatives include jfet switches both discrete and ic and diode switching which works relatively well surprisingly all the above with their pitfalls and application tips could easily make a subject for a multi page article solid state switches may induce a click of their own when turned on due to charge being injected into the audio line through device capacitance when the control signal changes state techniques to minimize this include lowering the impedance of the signal paths through the switch differential switching and slowing the risetime of the control pulse with the 4016 cutting the click can be as simple as putting 10k 47k resistors in series with the control pins hope this helps at least get you started dave medin phone 205 730 3169 w ssd networking 205 837 1174 h intergraph corp m s gd3004 internet dtmedin catbyte b30 ingr com huntsville al 35894 uucp uunet ingr b30 catbyte dtmedin everywhere you look at least around my office

3 | you should have heard prof mcnally from my days as an astronomy undergraduate denouncing photon pollution it was easy to imagine him taking practical steps to modify the sodium lamps on the street outside mill hill observatory with a 12 gauge shotgun however seriously it is possible to limit the effects of streetlights by adding a reflector so that the light only illuminates the ground which is after all where you need it as a bonus the power consumption required for a given illumination level is reduced strangely enough astronomers often seek to lobby elected local authorities to use such lighting systems with considerable success in the desert areas around the major us observatories at least thats what mcnally told us all those years ago british local authorities couldn t care less as far as i can see i suppose that the right to dark skies is no more than an aspiration but it is a worthwhile one illuminated orbital billboards seem especially yukky and are presumably in the area of international law if any although i do find the idea of a right to bear anti satellite weapons intriguing

3 | while i m sure sagan considers it sacrilegious that wouldn t be because of his doubtfull credibility as an astronomer modern ground based visible light astronomy what these proposed orbiting billboards would upset is already a dying field the opacity and distortions caused by the atmosphere itself have driven most of the field to use radio far infrared or space based telescopes hardly the keck telescope in hawaii has taken its first pictures they re nearly as good as hubble for a tiny fraction of the cost in any case a bright point of light passing through the field doesn t ruin observations if that were the case the thousands of existing satellites would have already done so satelliets might not seem so bright to the eyes but as far as astronomy is concerned they are extremely bright i believe that this orbiting space junk will be far brighter still more like the full moon the moon upsets deep sky observation all over the sky and not just looking at it because of scattered light this is a known problem but of course two weeks out of every four are ok what happens when this billboard circles every 90 minutes what would be a good time then frank crary cu boulder

2 | i ll tell you all that i know about chromium but before i do i want to get a few things off my chest i just got blasted in e mail for my kidney stone posts kidney stones are primarily caused by diet as is heart disease and cancer when i give dietary advise it is not intended to encourage people reading this news group or sci med nutrition where i do most of my posting to avoid seeing a doctor nothing can be further from the truth kidney stones can be caused by tumors and this possibility has to be ruled out but once it is diet is a good way of preventing a reoccurance same thing with heart disease and cancer if you suspect that you may have a problem with one of these diseases don t use what i m going to tell you or what you read in some book to avoid going to a doctor you have to go hopefully you will find a doctor who knows enough about nutrition to help you change your risk factors for both diseases as part of a treatment program but the odds are that you will not and that s why i m here when my wife detected a lump in here breast i didn t say don t worry my vitamin e will take care of it any breast lump has to be worked up by a physician plan and simple if it s begnin which most are fine then maybe a diet change and supplementation will prevent further breast lumps from occuring but let me tell you right now if you have tried diet and supplementation and another lump returns get your butt into the doctor s office as fast as your little feet can carry you better yet have a mammography done on a regular basis my wife kept putting her s off both myself and her gynocologist told her she needed to have one done her gynocologist even scheduled one but she didn t show up too busy running the operating room for the biggest hospital in tulsa one more thing i am not an orthomolecular nutritionist this group uses high dose vitamins and minerals to treat all kinds of disease there is absolutely no doubt in my mind that vitamins and minerals can and do have drug actions in the body but you talk about flying blind man this is really blind treatment no drug could ever be used as these vitamins and minerals are being used i m not saying that some of this stuff couldn t be right on the money it may well be but my approach to nutrition is a lot like that of weinsier and morgan the two m d s who wrote the new clinical nutrition textbook my push is the nutrient reserves and the lab tests needed to measure these reserves and then supplementation or diet changes to get these reserves built up to where they should be to let you handle stress that s where i m coming from folks blast away if you want i m not going to change put me in your killfile if you want i really don t care i m averaging 8 10 e mail messages a day from people who think that i ve got something important to say but i m also getting hit by a few with an axe to grind that s life chromium is one of the trace elements it has a very limited but very important role in the body it is used to form glucose tolerance factor gtf gtf is made up of chromium nicinamide niacin glycine cysteine and glutamic only the chromium and the niacin are needed from the diet to form gtf some foods already have gtf liver brewers or nutritional yeast and black pepper when chromium is in gtf a pretty good absorption is seen about 20 but when it is simply present as a mineral or mineral chelate chromium picolinate it s absorption is much lower 1 to 2 lowest for all the minerals i ve been posting in misc fitness and chromium has come up there several times as a fat burner chromium is among the least toxic of the minerals so you could really load yourself up and not really do any harm i wouldn t do it though the adequate and safe range for chromium is 50 to 200ug per day the average american is getting about 30ug per day from his her diet chromium levels decrease with age and many believe that adult onset diabetes is primarily a chromium deficiency i can cite you several studies that have been done with glucose tolerance in type ii diabetes but i m not going to because for each positive one there also seems to be a negative one as well i m convinced that the problem is bioavailability when yeast gtf is used good results are obtained but when chromium itself is used the results are usually negative in addition to type ii diabetes chromiuum has been examined in cardiovascular disease and glucoma again with mixed results as far as cardiovascular disease is concerned since a high blood glucose level can lead to cardiovascular disease this possible link with chromium isn t too surprising glucoma is a little more interesting muscle eye focusing activity is primarily an insulin responsive glucose driven metabolic function if this eye focusing activity is impaired by a lack of glucose due to a poor insulin response intraocular pressure is believed to be elevated in a fairly large study of 400 pts with glaucoma the one consistent finding was a low rbc chromium j am coll nutr 10 5 536 1991 but this one preliminary study should not prompt people to go out and start popping chromium supplements for one thing just about every older person is going to have a low rbc chromium unless they have been taking chromium suppleemnts yeast since glucoma is often found in older people it s not too surprising that chromium was low in the rbc s if chromium supplementation could reverse glucoma that would prompt some attention i suspect that there will be a clinical trail to check out this possible chromium link to glucoma you could find out what your body chromium pool size was by either the rbc chromium test or hair analysis most clinical labs are not going to run a rbc chromium there are plenty of labs that will do a hair and nail analysis for you but i wouldn t use them there is just too much funny business going on in these unregulated labs right now here s weinsier and morgan advise on chromium they do not consider chromium to be one of those minerals for which a reliable clinical test is available they don t like the hair and nail analysis labs either and they also recognize the rbc chromium is primarily a research test that is not routinely available in most clinical chemistry labs this has to change and as more labs run a rbc chromiuum it will what then do they suggest make a diagnosis of chromium deficiency based on a documented clinical response to chromium run a glucose tolerance test before and after chromium supplementation once you make the diagnosis put the patient on 200ug of crcl3 orally each day or 10grams of yeast per day what s my advise don t take chromium supplements to try to loose weight they just do not work that way if you want to take them and then exercise that would be great do include yeast as part of your diet most americans are not getting enough chromium from their diet if you do have a poor glucose tolerance ask your doctor to check your chromium status when he or she says what in the world are you talking about just say please get a copy of weinsier and morgan s new clinical nutrition textbook and do what they say to do with patients who present with a poor glucose tolerance if you can t do that i ll find a doctor who can thank you very much
2 | this is ridiculous and your doctor sounds like a nut if what is reported here is what the doctor actually said if your wife s pancreas stops producing insulin and therefore becomes diabetic she ll need insulin replacement that doesn t mean she s dependent on insulin anymore than she was beforehand if her body doesn t make enough she ll have to get it elsewhere oral thyroid replacement hormone therapy is the cornerstone of treatment for hypothyroidism and it s really the only effective therapy available anyway plus it s cheap taking thyroid hormone when it isn t needed does cause your thyroid gland to reduce its own production of the hormone but that s a _feature_ not a _bug_ and it s irrelevant in any case in the face of hypothyroidism because her problem that her gland isn t producing enough there isn t a clinical phenomenon of thyroid insufficiency caused by a sudden discontinuation of exogenous thyroid hormone analogous to adrenal insufficiency caused by the sudden cessation of prolonged administration of corticosteroids so there should be no worry about inappropriately suppressing the thyroid gland homeopathy is nonsense tell her to stop wasting her money health and time and get her to a legitimate doctor who will be in a position to make a proper diagnosis and recommend the right therapy
1 | i strongly disagree i think most pirating is done by amateurs who won t copy the program if diskcopy can t do it if you re talking a 20 max goal of pirated copies i bet that anything that will beat diskcopy and can t be easily copied from a hard drive will suffice i hate hard copy manuals and would rather have all docs online not because i want to copy the program but because its usually faster and and convenient than sifting through an old book i can t find off deeper end why does everyone think they need to be able to make a backup copy almost all new software must be installed to the hard disk so you are left with the originals as your backups i think its a waste of time space and money as well as it makes it to tempting to lend out the backups no flames intended just my thoughts
3 | this is a whole different situation if aliens were able to get here prior to us being able to get there one might conclude that they would be more advanced and therefore more intelegent that we are however if we get somewhere where there is life chances are we wont be able to communicate with them so we will have no clue as to weather they are intelegent or not that s a good point i hadn t thought of it that way my question however was more along the lines of every year the us spends millions of tax dollars and giving tax breaks to individuals and companies who feed the poor of foreign countries while thousands of our own people sleep on the streets at night would we give to the economicly dissadvantaged on another planet if we hadn t resolved these issues on our own but your comment brings up another good question over the years we have decided that certain cultures need improvements the native americans is a good example prior to our attempt to civilize them the native american culture had very little crime no homelessnes no poverty then the europeans came along and now they have those and more if we encounter life elsewhere do we tell them they have to live in houses farm the land and go to church on sunday have a day

2 | the following is based on copies i was given of some articles published in hearing instruments i would appreciate any comments about this and other new technology for hearing aids the resound system was developed on the basis of some research at at t and appears to take a different approach from other aids it appears to me that a new programmable aid like the widex just uses a more flexible and programmable version of the classical approach of amplifying some parts of the spectrum more than others and adding some compression to try and help out in noisy situations the major difference in the resound approach is that it divides the spectrum into low and high frequencies splitting point is programmable apparently based on the fact that lots of vowel information can be found in the low frequencies while the important consonant information unfortunately for me is in the high frequencies the two bands then are treated with different compression schemes which are programable they have also developed a new fitting algorythm that builds on what they call abnormal growth of loudness this latter is interesting and fits my own personal experience though i think the phrase is missleading what appears to be the case is that as you exceed the minimum threshold for a person with hearing loss the deficit becomes progresslively less compared to normals and by the time you reach the too loud point the sensitivity curves appear to converge this means that if you just boost all sound levels you are overloading at the high end for people with hearing losses hence what you want is progressively less amplification as the signal get closer to the maximum tolerable point you want to boost low volume sounds more than high and do so potentially differently for the low and high frequency parts of the spectrum specially for someone like me who is relatively normal up to 1000 cps and then falls off a cliff aids with simple compressors don t descriminate between energy in the low and high frequencies and can therefor compress useful high frequency information because of high volume of low frequency components particularly impressive was the resound performance with whispered speech and in simulated restaurant noise situations
2 | i am quite near sighted i ve recently received laser treatment for both eyes to seal holes in the retinas to help prevent retinal detachment in my left eye a small detachment had begun already and apparently the laser was used to weld this back in place as well my right eye seems fine in my left eye i was seeing occasional flashes of bright light prior to the treatment since the treatment two weeks these flashes are now occuring more often several each hour the opthamologist explained the flashes are caused because the vitreous body has attached to the retina and is pulling on it he says this is not treatable and he hopes it may go away on its own accord if it tugs enough i may well face retinal detachment i am seeking via sci med additional info on retinal detachments the dr did not wish to spend much time with me in explanations so i appreciate any further details anyone can provide of most interest to me if my retina does detach what should be my immediate course of action if conventional surgery is need to repair the detachment what is the procedure like and what kind of vision can i expect afterwards do the symptoms fairly frequent flashes imply that detachment maybe near at hand or is this not necessarily cause for alarm many thanks bill

1 | i hate to disagree but i will note i don t pirate software nor do i trade it i simply have met and talked extensively with those who have that s it the fbi can tap someone else s phone most pirating is done by people who don t use the programs they pirate a cracked program tends to get passed on resplendant in the various graphics and animations that advertise whoever performed the modification s i admit that a large portion of the business world is involved in giving copies of programs to one s fellow workers maybe taking it home for use on one s own pc but such trading tends to be interdepartmental or at most spread throughout the business as a whole how many times have you had someone walking from business to business letting people copy disks it s mostly a matter of convenience a person sees a program they want to use and they feel justified in making a copy since someone s already paid for it etc etc a note this is starting to change a bit not much though what about commercially available copy programs copyii how about programs like teledisk that can do things diskcopy can t and before anyone disputes this because they feel that those who would copy wouldn t know about this after working with people around computers one comes to realize that the average user doesn t know much any computer enthusiast is at least 200x better at pre guessing commands and how to use them can you sit down and use something without reading the manual and it is these people who are doing the 20 pirating not joe windows user who can t remember a few arguments to the dir command really i find it evens out the online stuff can be read through faster but you re stuck reading it in linear flow start to finish unless you jump ahead with a search or such a book though you can flip through faster than you can read text on a screen and they usually have a nifty index too but i partially agree i often wish i could grep something that was written down what if they need to re install the idea of a backup still holds if the original disk goes bad they re out of luck for about 1 2 weeks which is the usual turn around time for a company to send a new set of disks if they ll do it without a charge

3 | i d hardly call the current pluto fast flyby proposal too large if the new technology insertion currently taking place succeeds the s c mass will drop to 110 120 kg or too expensive 400 million fy92 for two s c especially when compared to other nasa planetary missions this proposal would work only if your various targets are relaively nearby and the require minimal delta v from the mother ship a mission to the main belt might be one possibility for such a mission i recall a paper being presented at an aiaa deisgn conference in irvine in february where such a proposed spacecraft was designed by some grad students at ut austin i think four mini spacecraft would detatch from the main s c each visiting a seperate asteroid and then returning to the main s c after analysis the main s c would then be targeted for the most interesting object for further study now if i could only find that paper
1 | you are quite correct in your understanding the filtering is not interpolation as that would distort the frequency content of the signal you are listening to generally these players run the samples thru an all pass filter network i have done this for ecg waveforms from a person s heart and the effect is rather spooky it actually reconstructs peaks that weren t there correctly too and fills in the gaps with the properly computed values just as if there had been a real sample taken at that point i use a cpu to do all the math it takes a decent but not unreasonable amount of cpu time to do this you can keep up with things in realtime if you write efficient code in case you care the filtering method uses an fir finite impulse response filter i d guess that cd makers use the same kind of method anybody out there know the real answer i d say that they use a tapped delay line with resistor op amp weighting to accomplish the filtering this strikes me as the most cost effective method for volume production runs actually i think the only reason they do this is so that they can say that they have a marketting gimic i would guess that it is acutally cheaper to filter an oversampled signal than not you can use sloppier components and give the filter a roll off that isn t so sharp it s too bad that they charge more for something that i think is actually less costly to build i seriously doubt that the filters cost the same but are better they are built to a price spec and that spec says cheap as possible dave
1 | pretty high frequency for one chip yes and no i would use the fm transmitter chip from motorola linear and interface databook a stable cristal oscillator and a mixer e g sbl 1 from mini circuits lab everything is done in the fm chip and then mixed up with the oscillator frequency just have a look at the arrl handbook there are lots of ideas in there about oscillators and mixing i don t think there are single chip designs for such high frequencies yet cheers robert hb9nby

2 | in article enea1 270493135255 enea apple com can anyone out there tell me the difference between a persistent disease and a chronic one for example persistent hepatitis vs chronic hepatitis i don t think there is a general distinction rather there are two classes of chronic hepatitis chronic active hepatitis and chronic persistent hepatitis i can t think of any other disease where the term persistent is used with or in preference to chronic much as these two terms chronic active and chronic persistent sound fuzzy the actual distinction between the two conditions is often fairly fuzzy as well i beg to differ chronic active hepatitis implies that the disease remains active and generally leads to liver failure at the very minimum the patient has persistently elevated liver enzymes what some call transaminitis chronic persistant hepatitis simply means that the patient has hbsag in his her blood and can transmit the infection but shows no evidence of progressive disease if i had to choose i d much rather have the persistant type

1 | i m looking for a circuit that will flash an led on in response to the output from a walkman cassette player how could i do this i don t want it just to turn on i want it to strobe once so to speak per every beep i put on a cassette tape would it be better to use a circuit based on the volume of the beeps on the cassette or better for the leds to respond to a tone of a certain frequency is there any easy way to do either of these i m looking for the simplest circuit possible i guess what i m asking for is some sort of color organ but not quite let me trt to explain again i m going to have a pattern of beats or beeps on a cassette tape so on the tape you d hear beep pause beep pause beep pause etc with speed increasing as time goes on i want to synchronize an led probably two of them with the beeps on the cassette tape so the led with each beep would go on and off real quick generating a strobe light sort of effect the rapidity of the beeps on the tape would in turn effect the rapidity of the blinking of the leds and if there was no sound on the tape except for background his the leds would remain off please help thanks

1 | um 1 your professor if just plain wrong although blue leds are one heck of a lot less efficient than red ones 2 typical visible light leds don t really exist leds have a fairly narrow region of transmittence since the fermi energy around either side of the band gap falls off exponentially blah blah you might want to check the copyright date on that blue leds most certainly do exist i ve got a bunch at work cree research makes them probably along with other companies cree is big in materials science though they advertise in the stuff like physics today etc you can buy them from jameco i think digikey definitely and plenty of other distributors actually these days you _can_ get a typical visible light led it s called a rainbow led and i ve forgotten who makes it they advertise in edn and many of the other trade rags though it combines a reg green and blue led all on one chip and has four leads nifty device although it s probably fairly expensive

3 | but i believe that there is a fundamental difference here the other x three instruments are focusing instruments that more or less form an image so positional errors are limited by craft attitude and the resolving power of the optics batse is an altogether different beast effectively just 8 coincidence counters one on each corner of the craft positional information is triangulated from the differential signal arrival times at each of the detectors positional error would be predominantly determined by timing errors and errors in craft attitude since none of the 8 baste detectors have any independant angular resolution whatsoever they can not be used to determine parallax indeed parallax would just add a very small component to the positional error demonstrating that these puppies are beyond the oort cloud would require resolution on the order of arcseconds since the oort cloud is postulated to extend to about 0 5 parsec all together now parallax arc second a parsec is the distance of an object that demonstrates one arc second of parallax with a 2 au base line if the 3 degree accuracy reported above is true we re going to have to add a baste to the pluto fast flyby to get enough baseline the beauty of baste is that it both gives positional information and watches the entire sky simultaneously a realy handy combination when you have no idea where the next burst is coming from
3 | you don t need to but it s desirable hst like all satellites in low earth orbit is gradually losing altitude due to air drag it was deployed in the highest orbit the shuttle could reach for that reason it needs occasional reboosting or it will eventually reenter it has no propulsion system of its own this is an excellent opportunity given that there may not be another visit for several years
2 | being a chronic hbsag carrier does not necessarily mean the patient has chronic persistent anything persons who are chronic carriers may have no clinical biochemical or histologic evidence of liver disease or they may have chronic persistent hepatitis chronic active hepatitis cirrhosis or hepatocellular carcinoma most cases of chronic persistent hepatitis cph are probably the result of a viral infection although in a good number of cases the cause cannot be determined the diagnosis of cph is made on the basis of liver biopsy it consists of findings of portal inflammation an intact periportal limiting plate and on occasion isolated foci of intralobular necrosis but in contrast to chronic active hepatitis cah there is no periportal inflammation bridging necrosis or fibrosis cph has indeed an excellent prognosis if i had to choose between cah and cph there is no question i would also choose cph however as david pointed out the distinction between the two is not as neat as some of us would have it the histology can sometimes be pretty equivocal with biopsies showing areas compatible with both cph and cah maybe it is a sampling problem maybe it is a continuum i don t know darn just when i think i understand something someone who knows the pathology has to burst my bubble we d better not start talking about glomerular diseases then i ll really get depressed seriously though i wonder how someone with cph would end up getting a biopsy in the first place my understanding and feel free to correct me is that the enzymes are at worst mildly elevated with overall normal hepatic function i would think that the only clue might be a history of prior hepb infection and a positive hepb sag or is it indeed on a continuum with cah and the distinction merely one of pathology and prognosis but otherwise identical clinical features

1 | charlie brett s suggestion buy one of the disposable flash cameras use the film then take the thing apart is a good one note though that you won t get a particularly precise voltage out of such a thing and it may be a single point design that won t adapt well to off nominal operation the things are easy to dismantle the key piece of information is that when you advance the film on one of them you are winding it into the film cassette it is unwound from the cassette in the factory when the camera is made so no darkroom is needed for dismantling it s standard film so just take the cassette in for processing all the camera store people do when you bring in one of the disposables is rip it apart toss the film cassette into the to be processed bin and throw the battery in one trashcan and the rest of the camera in another if you take it apart yourself you get an aa alkaline battery still with a fair bit of life in it and all kinds of little bits and pieces from the camera i expect you could even re load and re use the camera if you were really determined

1 | while it s possible that it s a ham radio transmitter that you re hearing it isn t likely every bit of signal that doesn t go out the antenna is wasted as far as a ham is concerned and most hams are it is the radiated signal that would cause the problem technically competent to ensure that they don t waste any signal if they can possibly avoid it to get their ham license they had to pass a government exam that tests them on that point among others however you could be hearing a radio transmitter for sure there are lots of other services where the operators aren t required to be technically competent citizens band cb for example there is nothing in the amateur radio tests that requires an technical competence at all it is a simple matter to memorize all the questions and answers however that said most hams that i know do spend quite a bit of time gaining some technical skill listen to the interference if you hear voices clearly it almost certainly isn t ham radio and might well be cb if you can record a don t count on that bit of it you could take the tape over to a local ham operator s house and ask him for his opinion of what you re hearing most communities you cannot do that legally however you can ask a ham over to listen if the interference occurs at a specific time each day then it would be possible to do such scheduling if nothing else you could invite the ham over to transmit from your driveway to see if he interferes if he does then you probably need to have your equipment worked on to make it immune to rf interference have a ham radio interference committee whose members are most willing to help you resolve interference complaints look in the phone book or ask at the local ham radio store or call the fcc for contact info the fcc may or may not have such information they have enough to do without getting calls for such information if nothing else call your city offices or police department general business number they should have the name of a local ham contact if it s a ham he s more than likely willing to help get rid of the problem after all it would be his signal he s wasting if it isn t the interference committee or the fcc may be able to suggest solutions see above your concept of wasted signal is erroneous if his rig is transmitting properly then the chance of interference with the exception of harmonic television interference is the greatest since he is putting out the strongest signal it is unfortunately the case that a transmitting station that is operating perfectly legally could possibly cause intereference to a piece of consumer audio or tv equipment just because the manufacturer of the consumer equipment cut corners on one little section of the device that wouldn t affect one person in a thousand but which bites you often that can be remedied for just a few pennies by a knowledgeable person perhaps even the person operating the transmitter you re hearing unfortunately most consumer equipment is succeptable it is all poorly designed btw hams are allowed amplifiers cb isn t illegal ham amplifier doesn t compute it does but not for a mobile radio there are very few mobile rigs that could power a 1500 watt amplifier

2 | the burden of proof rests upon those who claim the existence of this syndrome to date these claims are unsubstantiated by any available data hopefully as a scientist you would take issue with anyone overstating their conclusions based upon their data gee i have many interesting and enlightening anecdotes about myself my friends and my family but in the practice of medicine i expect and demand more rigorous rationales for basing therapy than aunt susie s brother in law anecdotal evidence may provide inspiration for a hypothesis but rarely proves anything in a positive sense and unlike mathematics boolean logic rarely applies directly to medical issues and so evidence of exceptions does not usually disprove but rather modifies current concepts of disease i would characterize it not as abject disbelief but rather scientific outrage over vastly overstated conclusions i have no problem with such an approach but this is not what is happening in the trenches of this diagnosis
2 | where are your references i have been unable to find studies that state that chromium cures diabetese it can reduce the amount of insulin you have to take high blood pressure i have never heard of this claim before anabolic steroids i have also never heard of this claim before sounds like you are making things up and stretching the truth for god knows what reason did somebody piss you off at one time i agree with you that chromium picolinate by itself isn t likely to make a fat person thin but it can be the decisive component of an overall strategy for long term weight control and make an important contribution to good health it is important to exercise 11 12 and also avoid fat calories 9 10 chromium picolinate has shown to reduce fat and increase lean muscle 1 2 3 i will not bore you with the statistics you wouldn t believe these anyway chromium picolinate is an exceptionally bioactive source of the essential mineral chromium chromium plays a vital role in sensitizing the body s tissues to the hormone insulin weight gain in the form of fat tends to impair sensitivity to insulin and thus in turn makes it harder to lose weight 4 insulin directly stimulates protein synthesis and retards protein breakdown in muscles 5 6 this protein sparing effect of insulin tends to decline during low calorie diets as insulin levels decline which results in loss of muscle and organ tissue by sensitizing muscle to insulin chromium picolinate helps to preserve muscle in dieters so that they burn more fat and less muscle preservation of lean body mass has an important long term positive effect on metabolic rate helping dieters keep off the fat they ve lost chromium picolinate promotes efficient metabolism by aiding the thermogenic heat producing effects of insulin insulin levels serve as a rough index of the availability of food calories so it s not at all surprising that insulin stimulates metabolism 4 7 8 note that i did not say that chromium picolinate increases metabolism in summary you need to change your life style in order to loose weight and stay healthy a reduce dietary fat consumption to no more than 20 of calories eating fat makes you fat b increase dietary fiber low in calories high in nutrients c get regular aerobic exercise at least 3 times a week burn calories d take chromium picolinate daily lose fat keep muscle references 1 kaats gr fisher ja blum k abstract american aging association 21st annual meeting denver october 1991 2 evans gw int j biosoc med res 1989 11 163 180 3 page tg ward tl southern ll j animal sci 69 suppl 1 abstract 403 1991 4 felig p clin physiol 1984 4 267 273 5 kimball sr jefferson ls diabetes metab rev 4 773 1988 6 fukugawa nk minaher kl rowe jw et al j clin invest 76 2306 1985 7 fehlmann m freychet p biol chem 256 7449 1981 8 pittman cs suda ak chambers jb jr ray gy metabolism 28 333 1979 9 danforth e jr am j clin nutr 41 1132 1985 10 mccarty mf med hypoth 20 183 1986 11 bielinski r schutz y jequier e am j clin nutr 42 69 1985 12 young jc treadway jl balon tw garvas hp ruderman nb metabolism 35 1048 1986

2 | i guess i m still not clear on what the term candida bloom means but certainly it is well known that thrush superficial candidal infections on mucous membranes can occur after antibiotic use this has nothing to do with systemic yeast syndrome the quack diagnosis that has been being discussed lucky how since a recent article randomized controlled trial of oral yogurt on reducing vaginal candidiasis i ve mentioned to a number of patients with frequent vaginal yeast infections that they could try eating 6 ounces of yogurt daily it turns out most would rather just use anti fungal creams when they get yeast infections again this just isn t what the systemic yeast syndrome is about and has nothing to do with the quack therapies that were being discussed there is some evidence that attempts to reinoculate the gi tract with bacteria after antibiotic therapy don t seem to be very helpful in reducing diarrhea but i don t think anyone would view this as a quack therapy

2 | hi stephen ear wax is a healthy way to help prevent ear infections both by preventing a barrier and also with some antibiotic properties too much can block the external auditory canal the hole in the outside of the ear and cause some hearing problems it is very simple and safe to remove excess wax on your own or at your physician s office you can take a syringe no needles and fill it with 50 warm water cold can cause fainting and 50 otc hydrogen peroxide then point the ear towards the ceiling about 45 degrees up and insert the tip of the syringe helps to have someone else do this and firmly expell the solution depending on the size of the syringe and the tenacity of the wax this could take several rinses if you place a bowl under the ear to catch the water it will be much drier you can buy a syringe with a special tip at your local pharmacy or just use whatever you may have if wax is old it will be harder and darker you can try adding a few drops of olive oil into the ear during a shower to soften up the wax do this for a couple days then try syringing again it is also safe to point your ear up at the shower head and allow the water to rinse it out good luck heather

your geographic region introduction from our small world we have gazed upon the cosmic ocean for untold thousands of years ancient astronomers observed points of light that appeared to move among the stars they called these objects planets meaning wanderers and named them after roman deities jupiter king of the gods mars the god of war mercury messenger of the gods venus the god of love and beauty and saturn father of jupiter and god of agriculture the stargazers also observed comets with sparkling tails and meteors or shooting stars apparently falling from the sky science flourished during the european renaissance fundamental physical laws governing planetary motion were discovered and the orbits of the planets around the sun were calculated in the 17th century astronomers pointed a new device called the telescope at the heavens and made startling discoveries but the years since 1959 have amounted to a golden age of solar system exploration advancements in rocketry after world war ii enabled our machines to break the grip of earth s gravity and travel to the moon and to other planets the united states has sent automated spacecraft then human crewed expeditions to explore the moon our automated machines have orbited and landed on venus and mars explored the sun s environment observed comets and made close range surveys while flying past mercury jupiter saturn uranus and neptune these travelers brought a quantum leap in our knowledge and understanding of the solar system through the electronic sight and other senses of our automated spacecraft color and complexion have been given to worlds that for centuries appeared to earth bound eyes as fuzzy disks or indistinct points of light and dozens of previously unknown objects have been discovered future historians will likely view these pioneering flights through the solar system as some of the most remarkable achievements of the 20th century automated spacecraft the national aeronautics and space administration s nasa s automated spacecraft for solar system exploration come in many shapes and sizes while they are designed to fulfill separate and specific mission objectives the craft share much in common each spacecraft consists of various scientific instruments selected for a particular mission supported by basic subsystems for electrical power trajectory and orientation control as well as for processing data and communicating with earth electrical power is required to operate the spacecraft instruments and systems nasa uses both solar energy from arrays of photovoltaic cells and small nuclear generators to power its solar system missions rechargeable batteries are employed for backup and supplemental power imagine that a spacecraft has successfully journeyed millions of miles through space to fly but one time near a planet only to have its cameras and other sensing instruments pointed the wrong way as it speeds past the target to help prevent such a mishap a subsystem of small thrusters is used to control spacecraft the thrusters are linked with devices that maintain a constant gaze at selected stars just as earth s early seafarers used the stars to navigate the oceans spacecraft use stars to maintain their bearings in space with the subsystem locked onto fixed points of reference flight controllers can keep a spacecraft s scientific instruments pointed at the target body and the craft s communications antennas pointed toward earth the thrusters can also be used to fine tune the flight path and speed of the spacecraft to ensure that a target body is encountered at the planned distance and on the proper trajectory between 1959 and 1971 nasa spacecraft were dispatched to study the moon and the solar environment they also scanned the inner planets other than earth mercury venus and mars these three worlds and our own are known as the terrestrial planets because they share a solid rock composition for the early planetary reconnaissance missions nasa employed a highly successful series of spacecraft called the mariners their flights helped shape the planning of later missions between 1962 and 1975 seven mariner missions conducted the first surveys of our planetary neighbors in space all of the mariners used solar panels as their primary power source the first and the final versions of the spacecraft had two wings covered with photovoltaic cells other mariners were equipped with four solar panels extending from their octagonal bodies although the mariners ranged from the mariner 2 venus spacecraft weighing in at 203 kilograms 447 pounds to the mariner 9 mars orbiter weighing in at 974 kilograms 2 147 pounds their basic design remained quite similar throughout the program the mariner 5 venus spacecraft for example had originally been a backup for the mariner 4 mars flyby the mariner 10 spacecraft sent to venus and mercury used components left over from the mariner 9 mars orbiter program in 1972 nasa launched pioneer 10 a jupiter spacecraft interest was shifting to four of the outer planets jupiter saturn uranus and neptune giant balls of dense gas quite different from the terrestrial worlds we had already surveyed four nasa spacecraft in all two pioneers and two voyagers were sent in the 1970s to tour the outer regions of our solar system because of the distances involved these travelers took anywhere from 20 months to 12 years to reach their destinations barring faster spacecraft they will eventually become the first human artifacts to journey to distant stars because the sun s light becomes so faint in the outer solar system these travelers do not use solar power but instead operate on electricity generated by heat from the decay of radioisotopes nasa also developed highly specialized spacecraft to revisit our neighbors mars and venus in the middle and late 1970s twin viking landers were equipped to serve as seismic and weather stations and as biology laboratories two advanced orbiters descendants of the mariner craft carried the viking landers from earth and then studied martian features from above two drum shaped pioneer spacecraft visited venus in 1978 the pioneer venus orbiter was equipped with a radar instrument that allowed it to see through the planet s dense cloud cover to study surface features the pioneer venus multiprobe carried four probes that were dropped through the clouds the probes and the main body all of which contained scientific instruments radioed information about the planet s atmosphere during their descent toward the surface a new generation of automated spacecraft including magellan galileo ulysses mars observer the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf and cassini is being developed and sent out into the solar system to make detailed examinations that will increase our understanding of our neighborhood and our own planet the sun a discussion of the objects in the solar system must start with the sun the sun dwarfs the other bodies representing approximately 99 86 percent of all the mass in the solar system all of the planets moons asteroids comets dust and gas add up to only about 0 14 percent this 0 14 percent represents the material left over from the sun s formation one hundred and nine earths would be required to fit across the sun s disk and its interior could hold over 1 3 million earths as a star the sun generates energy through the process of fusion the temperature at the sun s core is 15 million degrees celsius 27 million degrees fahrenheit and the pressure there is 340 billion times earth s air pressure at sea level the sun s surface temperature of 5 500 degrees celsius 10 000 degrees fahrenheit seems almost chilly compared to its core temperature at the solar core hydrogen can fuse into helium producing energy the sun also produces a strong magnetic field and streams of charged particles both extending far beyond the planets the sun appears to have been active for 4 6 billion years and has enough fuel to go on for another five billion years or so at the end of its life the sun will start to fuse helium into heavier elements and begin to swell up ultimately growing so large that it will swallow earth after a billion years as a red giant it will suddenly collapse into a white dwarf the final end product of a star like ours it may take a trillion years to cool off completely many spacecraft have explored the sun s environment but none have gotten any closer to its surface than approximately two thirds of the distance from earth to the sun pioneers 5 11 the pioneer venus orbiter voyagers 1 and 2 and other spacecraft have all sampled the solar environment the ulysses spacecraft launched on october 6 1990 is a joint solar mission of nasa and the european space agency after using jupiter s gravity to change its trajectory ulysses will fly over the sun s polar regions during 1994 and 1995 and will perform a wide range of studies using nine onboard scientific instruments we are fortunate that the sun is exactly the way it is if it were different in almost any way life would almost certainly never have developed on earth mercury obtaining the first close up views of mercury was the primary objective of the mariner 10 spacecraft launched on november 3 1973 from kennedy space center in florida after a journey of nearly five months which included a flyby of venus the spacecraft passed within 703 kilometers 437 miles of the solar system s innermost planet on march 29 1974 until mariner 10 little was known about mercury even the best telescopic views from earth showed mercury as an indistinct object lacking any surface detail the planet is so close to the sun that it is usually lost in solar glare when the planet is visible on earth s horizon just after sunset or before dawn it is obscured by the haze and dust in our atmosphere only radar telescopes gave any hint of mercury s surface conditions prior to the voyage of mariner 10 the photographs mariner 10 radioed back to earth revealed an ancient heavily cratered surface closely resembling our own moon the pictures also showed huge cliffs crisscrossing the planet these apparently were created when mercury s interior cooled and shrank buckling the planet s crust the cliffs are as high as 3 kilometers 2 miles and as long as 500 kilometers 310 miles instruments on mariner 10 discovered that mercury has a weak magnetic field and a trace of atmosphere a trillionth the density of earth s atmosphere and composed chiefly of argon neon and helium when the planet s orbit takes it closest to the sun surface temperatures range from 467 degrees celsius 872 degrees fahrenheit on mercury s sunlit side to 183 degrees celsius 298 degrees fahrenheit on the dark side this range in surface temperature 650 degrees celsius 1 170 degrees fahrenheit is the largest for a single body in the solar system mercury literally bakes and freezes at the same time days and nights are long on mercury the combination of a slow rotation relative to the stars 59 earth days and a rapid revolution around the sun 88 earth days means that one mercury solar day takes 176 earth days or two mercury years the time it takes the innermost planet to complete two orbits around the sun mercury appears to have a crust of light silicate rock like that of earth scientists believe mercury has a heavy iron rich core making up slightly less than half of its volume that would make mercury s core larger proportionally than the moon s core or those of any of the planets after the initial mercury encounter mariner 10 made two additional flybys on september 21 1974 and march 16 1975 before control gas used to orient the spacecraft was exhausted and the mission was concluded each flyby took place at the same local mercury time when the identical half of the planet was illuminated as a result we still have not seen one half of the planet s surface venus veiled by dense cloud cover venus our nearest planetary neighbor was the first planet to be explored the mariner 2 spacecraft launched on august 27 1962 was the first of more than a dozen successful american and soviet missions to study the mysterious planet as spacecraft flew by or orbited venus plunged into the atmosphere or gently landed on venus surface romantic myths and speculations about our neighbor were laid to rest on december 14 1962 mariner 2 passed within 34 839 kilometers 21 648 miles of venus and became the first spacecraft to scan another planet onboard instruments measured venus for 42 minutes mariner 5 launched in june 1967 flew much closer to the planet passing within 4 094 kilometers 2 544 miles of venus on the second american flyby mariner 5 s instruments measured the planet s magnetic field ionosphere radiation belts and temperatures on its way to mercury mariner 10 flew by venus and transmitted ultraviolet pictures to earth showing cloud circulation patterns in the venusian atmosphere in the spring and summer of 1978 two spacecraft were launched to further unravel the mysteries of venus on december 4 of the same year the pioneer venus orbiter became the first spacecraft placed in orbit around the planet five days later the five separate components making up the second spacecraft the pioneer venus multiprobe entered the venusian atmosphere at different locations above the planet the four small independent probes and the main body radioed atmospheric data back to earth during their descent toward the surface although designed to examine the atmosphere one of the probes survived its impact with the surface and continued to transmit data for another hour venus resembles earth in size physical composition and density more closely than any other known planet however spacecraft have discovered significant differences as well for example venus rotation west to east is retrograde backward compared to the east to west spin of earth and most of the other planets approximately 96 5 percent of venus atmosphere 95 times as dense as earth s is carbon dioxide the principal constituent of earth s atmosphere is nitrogen venus atmosphere acts like a greenhouse permitting solar radiation to reach the surface but trapping the heat that would ordinarily be radiated back into space as a result the planet s average surface temperature is 482 degrees celsius 900 degrees fahrenheit hot enough to melt lead a radio altimeter on the pioneer venus orbiter provided the first means of seeing through the planet s dense cloud cover and determining surface features over almost the entire planet nasa s magellan spacecraft launched on may 5 1989 has been in orbit around venus since august 10 1990 the spacecraft uses radar mapping techniques to provide ultrahigh resolution images of the surface magellan has revealed a landscape dominated by volcanic features faults and impact craters huge areas of the surface show evidence of multiple periods of lava flooding with flows lying on top of previous ones an elevated region named ishtar terra is a lava filled basin as large as the united states at one end of this plateau sits maxwell montes a mountain the size of mount everest scarring the mountain s flank is a 100 kilometer 62 mile wide 2 5 kilometer 1 5 mile deep impact crater named cleopatra almost all features on venus are named for women maxwell montes alpha regio and beta regio are the exceptions craters survive on venus for perhaps 400 million years because there is no water and very little wind erosion extensive fault line networks cover the planet probably the result of the same crustal flexing that produces plate tectonics on earth but on venus the surface temperature is sufficient to weaken the rock which cracks just about everywhere preventing the formation of major plates and large earthquake faults like the san andreas fault in california venus predominant weather pattern is a high altitude high speed circulation of clouds that contain sulfuric acid at speeds reaching as high as 360 kilometers 225 miles per hour the clouds circle the planet in only four earth days the circulation is in the same direction west to east as venus slow rotation of 243 earth days whereas earth s winds blow in both directions west to east and east to west in six alternating bands venus atmosphere serves as a simplified laboratory for the study of our weather earth as viewed from space our world s distinguishing characteristics are its blue waters brown and green land masses and white clouds we are enveloped by an ocean of air consisting of 78 percent nitrogen 21 percent oxygen and 1 percent other constituents the only planet in the solar system known to harbor life earth orbits the sun at an average distance of 150 million kilometers 93 million miles earth is the third planet from the sun and the fifth largest in the solar system with a diameter just a few hundred kilometers larger than that of venus our planet s rapid spin and molten nickel iron core give rise to an extensive magnetic field which along with the atmosphere shields us from nearly all of the harmful radiation coming from the sun and other stars earth s atmosphere protects us from meteors as well most of which burn up before they can strike the surface active geological processes have left no evidence of the pelting earth almost certainly received soon after it formed about 4 6 billion years ago along with the other newly formed planets it was showered by space debris in the early days of the solar system from our journeys into space we have learned much about our home planet the first american satellite explorer 1 was launched from cape canaveral in florida on january 31 1958 and discovered an intense radiation zone now called the van allen radiation belts surrounding earth since then other research satellites have revealed that our planet s magnetic field is distorted into a tear drop shape by the solar wind the stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the sun we ve learned that the magnetic field does not fade off into space but has definite boundaries and we now know that our wispy upper atmosphere once believed calm and uneventful seethes with activity swelling by day and contracting by night affected by changes in solar activity the upper atmosphere contributes to weather and climate on earth besides affecting earth s weather solar activity gives rise to a dramatic visual phenomenon in our atmosphere when charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in earth s magnetic field they collide with air molecules above our planet s magnetic poles these air molecules then begin to glow and are known as the auroras or the northern and southern lights satellites about 35 789 kilometers 22 238 miles out in space play a major role in daily local weather forecasting these watchful electronic eyes warn us of dangerous storms continuous global monitoring provides a vast amount of useful data and contributes to a better understanding of earth s complex weather systems from their unique vantage points satellites can survey earth s oceans land use and resources and monitor the planet s health these eyes in space have saved countless lives provided tremendous conveniences and shown us that we may be altering our planet in dangerous ways the moon the moon is earth s single natural satellite the first human footsteps on an alien world were made by american astronauts on the dusty surface of our airless lifeless companion in preparation for the human crewed apollo expeditions nasa dispatched the automated ranger surveyor and lunar orbiter spacecraft to study the moon between 1964 and 1968 nasa s apollo program left a large legacy of lunar materials and data six two astronaut crews landed on and explored the lunar surface between 1969 and 1972 carrying back a collection of rocks and soil weighing a total of 382 kilograms 842 pounds and consisting of more than 2 000 separate samples from this material and other studies scientists have constructed a history of the moon that includes its infancy rocks collected from the lunar highlands date to about 4 0 4 3 billion years old the first few million years of the moon s existence were so violent that few traces of this period remain as a molten outer layer gradually cooled and solidified into different kinds of rock the moon was bombarded by huge asteroids and smaller objects some of the asteroids were as large as rhode island or delaware and their collisions with the moon created basins hundreds of kilometers across this catastrophic bombardment tapered off approximately four billion years ago leaving the lunar highlands covered with huge overlapping craters and a deep layer of shattered and broken rock heat produced by the decay of radioactive elements began to melt the interior of the moon at depths of about 200 kilometers 125 miles below the surface then for the next 700 million years from about 3 8 to 3 1 billion years ago lava rose from inside the moon the lava gradually spread out over the surface flooding the large impact basins to form the dark areas that galileo galilei an astronomer of the italian renaissance called maria meaning seas as far as we can tell there has been no significant volcanic activity on the moon for more than three billion years since then the lunar surface has been altered only by micrometeorites by the atomic particles from the sun and stars by the rare impacts of large meteorites and by spacecraft and astronauts if our astronauts had landed on the moon a billion years ago they would have seen a landscape very similar to the one today thousands of years from now the footsteps left by the apollo crews will remain sharp and clear the origin of the moon is still a mystery four theories attempt an explanation the moon formed near earth as a separate body it was torn from earth it formed somewhere else and was captured by our planet s gravity or it was the result of a collision between earth and an asteroid about the size of mars the last theory has some good support but is far from certain mars of all the planets mars has long been considered the solar system s prime candidate for harboring extraterrestrial life astronomers studying the red planet through telescopes saw what appeared to be straight lines crisscrossing its surface these observations later determined to be optical illusions led to the popular notion that intelligent beings had constructed a system of irrigation canals on the planet in 1938 when orson welles broadcast a radio drama based on the science fiction classic war of the worlds by h g wells enough people believed in the tale of invading martians to cause a near panic another reason for scientists to expect life on mars had to do with the apparent seasonal color changes on the planet s surface this phenomenon led to speculation that conditions might support a bloom of martian vegetation during the warmer months and cause plant life to become dormant during colder periods so far six american missions to mars have been carried out four mariner spacecraft three flying by the planet and one placed into martian orbit surveyed the planet extensively before the viking orbiters and landers arrived mariner 4 launched in late 1964 flew past mars on july 14 1965 coming within 9 846 kilometers 6 118 miles of the surface transmitting to earth 22 close up pictures of the planet the spacecraft found many craters and naturally occurring channels but no evidence of artificial canals or flowing water mariners 6 and 7 followed with their flybys during the summer of 1969 and returned 201 pictures mariners 4 6 and 7 showed a diversity of surface conditions as well as a thin cold dry atmosphere of carbon dioxide on may 30 1971 the mariner 9 orbiter was launched on a mission to make a year long study of the martian surface the spacecraft arrived five and a half months after lift off only to find mars in the midst of a planet wide dust storm that made surface photography impossible for several weeks but after the storm cleared mariner 9 began returning the first of 7 329 pictures these revealed previously unknown martian features including evidence that large amounts of water once flowed across the surface etching river valleys and flood plains in august and september 1975 the viking 1 and 2 spacecraft each consisting of an orbiter and a lander lifted off from kennedy space center the mission was designed to answer several questions about the red planet including is there life there nobody expected the spacecraft to spot martian cities but it was hoped that the biology experiments on the viking landers would at least find evidence of primitive life past or present viking lander 1 became the first spacecraft to successfully touch down on another planet when it landed on july 20 1976 while the united states was celebrating its bicentennial photos sent back from the chryse planitia plains of gold showed a bleak rusty red landscape panoramic images returned by the lander revealed a rolling plain littered with rocks and marked by rippled sand dunes fine red dust from the martian soil gives the sky a salmon hue when viking lander 2 touched down on utopia planitia on september 3 1976 it viewed a more rolling landscape than the one seen by its predecessor one without visible dunes the results sent back by the laboratory on each viking lander were inconclusive small samples of the red martian soil were tested in three different experiments designed to detect biological processes while some of the test results seemed to indicate biological activity later analysis confirmed that this activity was inorganic in nature and related to the planet s soil chemistry is there life on mars no one knows for sure but the viking mission found no evidence that organic molecules exist there the viking landers became weather stations recording wind velocity and direction as well as atmospheric temperature and pressure few weather changes were observed the highest temperature recorded by either craft was 14 degrees celsius 7 degrees fahrenheit at the viking lander 1 site in midsummer the lowest temperature 120 degrees celsius 184 degrees fahrenheit was recorded at the more northerly viking lander 2 site during winter near hurricane wind speeds were measured at the two martian weather stations during global dust storms but because the atmosphere is so thin wind force is minimal viking lander 2 photographed light patches of frost probably water ice during its second winter on the planet the martian atmosphere like that of venus is primarily carbon dioxide nitrogen and oxygen are present only in small percentages martian air contains only about 1 1 000 as much water as our air but even this small amount can condense out forming clouds that ride high in the atmosphere or swirl around the slopes of towering volcanoes local patches of early morning fog can form in valleys there is evidence that in the past a denser martian atmosphere may have allowed water to flow on the planet physical features closely resembling shorelines gorges riverbeds and islands suggest that great rivers once marked the planet mars has two moons phobos and deimos they are small and irregularly shaped and possess ancient cratered surfaces it is possible the moons were originally asteroids that ventured too close to mars and were captured by its gravity the viking orbiters and landers exceeded by large margins their design lifetimes of 120 and 90 days respectively the first to fail was viking orbiter 2 which stopped operating on july 24 1978 when a leak depleted its attitude control gas viking lander 2 operated until april 12 1980 when it was shut down because of battery degeneration viking orbiter 1 quit on august 7 1980 when the last of its attitude control gas was used up viking lander 1 ceased functioning on november 13 1983 despite the inconclusive results of the viking biology experiments we know more about mars than any other planet except earth nasa s mars observer spacecraft to be launched in september 1992 will expand our knowledge of the martian environment and lead to human exploration of the red planet asteroids the solar system has a large number of rocky and metallic objects that are in orbit around the sun but are too small to be considered full fledged planets these objects are known as asteroids or minor planets most but not all are found in a band or belt between the orbits of mars and jupiter some have orbits that cross earth s path and there is evidence that earth has been hit by asteroids in the past one of the least eroded best preserved examples is the barringer meteor crater near winslow arizona asteroids are material left over from the formation of the solar system one theory suggests that they are the remains of a planet that was destroyed in a massive collision long ago more likely asteroids are material that never coalesced into a planet in fact if the estimated total mass of all asteroids was gathered into a single object the object would be only about 1 500 kilometers 932 miles across less than half the diameter of our moon thousands of asteroids have been identified from earth it is estimated that 100 000 are bright enough to eventually be photographed through earth based telescopes much of our understanding about asteroids comes from examining pieces of space debris that fall to the surface of earth asteroids that are on a collision course with earth are called meteoroids when a meteoroid strikes our atmosphere at high velocity friction causes this chunk of space matter to incinerate in a streak of light known as a meteor if the meteoroid does not burn up completely what s left strikes earth s surface and is called a meteorite one of the best places to look for meteorites is the ice cap of antarctica of all the meteorites examined 92 8 percent are composed of silicate stone and 5 7 percent are composed of iron and nickel the rest are a mixture of the three materials stony meteorites are the hardest to identify since they look very much like terrestrial rocks since asteroids are material from the very early solar system scientists are interested in their composition spacecraft that have flown through the asteroid belt have found that the belt is really quite empty and that asteroids are separated by very large distances current and future missions will fly by selected asteroids for closer examination the galileo orbiter launched by nasa in october 1989 will investigate main belt asteroids on its way to jupiter the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf and cassini missions will also study these far flung objects scheduled for launch in the latter part of the 1990s the craf and cassini missions are a collaborative project of nasa the european space agency and the federal space agencies of germany and italy as well as the united states air force and the department of energy one day space factories will mine the asteroids for raw materials jupiter beyond mars and the asteroid belt in the outer regions of our solar system lie the giant planets of jupiter saturn uranus and neptune in 1972 nasa dispatched the first of four spacecraft slated to conduct the initial surveys of these colossal worlds of gas and their moons of ice and rock jupiter was the first port of call pioneer 10 which lifted off from kennedy space center in march 1972 was the first spacecraft to penetrate the asteroid belt and travel to the outer regions of the solar system in december 1973 it returned the first close up images of jupiter flying within 132 252 kilometers 82 178 miles of the planet s banded cloud tops pioneer 11 followed a year later voyagers 1 and 2 were launched in the summer of 1977 and returned spectacular photographs of jupiter and its family of satellites during flybys in 1979 these travelers found jupiter to be a whirling ball of liquid hydrogen and helium topped with a colorful atmosphere composed mostly of gaseous hydrogen and helium ammonia ice crystals form white jovian clouds sulfur compounds and perhaps phosphorus may produce the brown and orange hues that characterize jupiter s atmosphere it is likely that methane ammonia water and other gases react to form organic molecules in the regions between the planet s frigid cloud tops and the warmer hydrogen ocean lying below because of jupiter s atmospheric dynamics however these organic compounds if they exist are probably short lived the great red spot has been observed for centuries through telescopes on earth this hurricane like storm in jupiter s atmosphere is more than twice the size of our planet as a high pressure region the great red spot spins in a direction opposite to that of low pressure storms on jupiter it is surrounded by swirling currents that rotate around the spot and are sometimes consumed by it the great red spot might be a million years old our spacecraft detected lightning in jupiter s upper atmosphere and observed auroral emissions similar to earth s northern lights at the jovian polar regions voyager 1 returned the first images of a faint narrow ring encircling jupiter largest of the solar system s planets jupiter rotates at a dizzying pace once every 9 hours 55 minutes 30 seconds the massive planet takes almost 12 earth years to complete a journey around the sun with 16 known moons jupiter is something of a miniature solar system a new mission to jupiter the galileo project is under way after a six year cruise that takes the galileo orbiter once past venus twice past earth and the moon and once past two asteroids the spacecraft will drop an atmospheric probe into jupiter s cloud layers and relay data back to earth the galileo orbiter will spend two years circling the planet and flying close to jupiter s large moons exploring in detail what the two pioneers and two voyagers revealed galilean satellites in 1610 galileo galilei aimed his telescope at jupiter and spotted four points of light orbiting the planet for the first time humans had seen the moons of another world in honor of their discoverer these four bodies would become known as the galilean satellites or moons but galileo might have happily traded this honor for one look at the dazzling photographs returned by the voyager spacecraft as they flew past these planet sized satellites one of the most remarkable findings of the voyager mission was the presence of active volcanoes on the galilean moon io volcanic eruptions had never before been observed on a world other than earth the voyager cameras identified at least nine active volcanoes on io with plumes of ejected material extending as far as 280 kilometers 175 miles above the moon s surface io s pizza colored terrain marked by orange and yellow hues is probably the result of sulfur rich materials brought to the surface by volcanic activity volcanic activity on this satellite is the result of tidal flexing caused by the gravitational tug of war between io jupiter and the other three galilean moons europa approximately the same size as our moon is the brightest galilean satellite the moon s surface displays a complex array of streaks indicating the crust has been fractured caught in a gravitational tug of war like io europa has been heated enough to cause its interior ice to melt apparently producing a liquid water ocean this ocean is covered by an ice crust that has formed where water is exposed to the cold of space europa s core is made of rock that sank to its center like europa the other two galilean moons ganymede and callisto are worlds of ice and rock ganymede is the largest satellite in the solar system larger than the planets mercury and pluto the satellite is composed of about 50 percent water or ice and the rest rock ganymede s surface has areas of different brightness indicating that in the past material oozed out of the moon s interior and was deposited at various locations on the surface callisto only slightly smaller than ganymede has the lowest density of any galilean satellite suggesting that large amounts of water are part of its composition callisto is the most heavily cratered object in the solar system no activity during its history has erased old craters except more impacts detailed studies of all the galilean satellites will be performed by the galileo orbiter saturn no planet in the solar system is adorned like saturn its exquisite ring system is unrivaled like jupiter saturn is composed mostly of hydrogen but in contrast to the vivid colors and wild turbulence found in jovian clouds saturn s atmosphere has a more subtle butterscotch hue and its markings are muted by high altitude haze given saturn s somewhat placid looking appearance scientists were surprised at the high velocity equatorial jet stream that blows some 1 770 kilometers 1 100 miles per hour three american spacecraft have visited saturn pioneer 11 sped by the planet and its moon titan in september 1979 returning the first close up images voyager 1 followed in november 1980 sending back breathtaking photographs that revealed for the first time the complexities of saturn s ring system and moons voyager 2 flew by the planet and its moons in august 1981 the rings are composed of countless low density particles orbiting individually around saturn s equator at progressive distances from the cloud tops analysis of spacecraft radio waves passing through the rings showed that the particles vary widely in size ranging from dust to house sized boulders the rings are bright because they are mostly ice and frosted rock the rings might have resulted when a moon or a passing body ventured too close to saturn the unlucky object would have been torn apart by great tidal forces on its surface and in its interior or the object may not have been fully formed to begin with and disintegrated under the influence of saturn s gravity a third possibility is that the object was shattered by collisions with larger objects orbiting the planet unable either to form into a moon or to drift away from each other individual ring particles appear to be held in place by the gravitational pull of saturn and its satellites these complex gravitational interactions form the thousands of ringlets that make up the major rings radio emissions quite similar to the static heard on an am car radio during an electrical storm were detected by the voyager spacecraft these emissions are typical of lightning but are believed to be coming from saturn s ring system rather than its atmosphere where no lightning was observed as they had at jupiter the voyagers saw a version of earth s auroras near saturn s poles the voyagers discovered new moons and found several satellites that share the same orbit we learned that some moons shepherd ring particles maintaining saturn s rings and the gaps in the rings saturn s 18th moon was discovered in 1990 from images taken by voyager 2 in 1981 voyager 1 determined that titan has a nitrogen based atmosphere with methane and argon one more like earth s in composition than the carbon dioxide atmospheres of mars and venus titan s surface temperature of 179 degrees celsius 290 degrees fahrenheit implies that there might be water ice islands rising above oceans of ethane methane liquid or sludge unfortunately voyager s cameras could not penetrate the moon s dense clouds continuing photochemistry from solar radiation may be converting titan s methane to ethane acetylene and in combination with nitrogen hydrogen cyanide the latter compound is a building block of amino acids these conditions may be similar to the atmospheric conditions of primeval earth between three and four billion years ago however titan s atmospheric temperature is believed to be too low to permit progress beyond this stage of organic chemistry the exploration of saturn will continue with the cassini mission the cassini spacecraft will orbit the planet and will also deploy a probe called huygens which will be dropped into titan s atmosphere and fall to the surface cassini will use the probe as well as radar to peer through titan s clouds and will spend years examining the saturnian system uranus in january 1986 four and a half years after visiting saturn voyager 2 completed the first close up survey of the uranian system the brief flyby revealed more information about uranus and its retinue of icy moons than had been gleaned from ground observations since the planet s discovery over two centuries ago by the english astronomer william herschel uranus third largest of the planets is an oddball of the solar system unlike the other planets with the exception of pluto this giant lies tipped on its side with its north and south poles alternately facing the sun during an 84 year swing around the solar system during voyager 2 s flyby the south pole faced the sun uranus might have been knocked over when an earth sized object collided with it early in the life of the solar system voyager 2 found that uranus magnetic field does not follow the usual north south axis found on the other planets instead the field is tilted 60 degrees and offset from the planet s center a phenomenon that on earth would be like having one magnetic pole in new york city and the other in the city of djakarta on the island of java in indonesia uranus atmosphere consists mainly of hydrogen with some 12 percent helium and small amounts of ammonia methane and water vapor the planet s blue color occurs because methane in its atmosphere absorbs all other colors wind speeds range up to 580 kilometers 360 miles per hour and temperatures near the cloud tops average 221 degrees celsius 366 degrees fahrenheit uranus sunlit south pole is shrouded in a kind of photochemical smog believed to be a combination of acetylene ethane and other sunlight generated chemicals surrounding the planet s atmosphere and extending thousands of kilometers into space is a mysterious ultraviolet sheen known as electroglow approximately 8 000 kilometers 5 000 miles below uranus cloud tops there is thought to be a scalding ocean of water and dissolved ammonia some 10 000 kilometers 6 200 miles deep beneath this ocean is an earth sized core of heavier materials voyager 2 discovered 10 new moons 16 169 kilometers 10 105 miles in diameter orbiting uranus the five previously known miranda ariel umbriel titania and oberon range in size from 520 to 1 610 kilometers 323 to 1 000 miles across representing a geological showcase these five moons are half ice half rock spheres that are cold and dark and show evidence of past activity including faulting and ice flows the most remarkable of uranus moons is miranda its surface features high cliffs as well as canyons crater pocked plains and winding valleys the sharp variations in terrain suggest that after the moon formed it was smashed apart by a collision with another body an event not unusual in our solar system which contains many objects that have impact craters or are fragments from large impacts what is extraordinary is that miranda apparently reformed with some of the material that had been in its interior exposed on its surface uranus was thought to have nine dark rings voyager 2 imaged 11 in contrast to saturn s rings which are composed of bright particles uranus rings are primarily made up of dark boulder sized chunks neptune voyager 2 completed its 12 year tour of the solar system with an investigation of neptune and the planet s moons on august 25 1989 the spacecraft swept to within 4 850 kilometers 3 010 miles of neptune and then flew on to the moon triton during the neptune encounter it became clear that the planet s atmosphere was more active than uranus voyager 2 observed the great dark spot a circular storm the size of earth in neptune s atmosphere resembling jupiter s great red spot the storm spins counterclockwise and moves westward at almost 1 200 kilometers 745 miles per hour voyager 2 also noted a smaller dark spot and a fast moving cloud dubbed the scooter as well as high altitude clouds over the main hydrogen and helium cloud deck the highest wind speeds of any planet were observed up to 2 400 kilometers 1 500 miles per hour like the other giant planets neptune has a gaseous hydrogen and helium upper layer over a liquid interior the planet s core contains a higher percentage of rock and metal than those of the other gas giants neptune s distinctive blue appearance like uranus blue color is due to atmospheric methane neptune s magnetic field is tilted relative to the planet s spin axis and is not centered at the core this phenomenon is similar to uranus magnetic field and suggests that the fields of the two giants are being generated in an area above the cores where the pressure is so great that liquid hydrogen assumes the electrical properties of a metal earth s magnetic field on the other hand is produced by its spinning metallic core and is only slightly tilted and offset relative to its center voyager 2 also shed light on the mystery of neptune s rings observations from earth indicated that there were arcs of material in orbit around the giant planet it was not clear how neptune could have arcs and how these could be kept from spreading out into even unclumped rings voyager 2 detected these arcs but they were in fact part of thin complete rings a number of small moons could explain the arcs but such bodies were not spotted astronomers had identified the neptunian moons triton in 1846 and nereid in 1949 voyager 2 found six more one of the new moons proteus is actually larger than nereid but since proteus orbits close to neptune it was lost in the planet s glare for observers on earth triton circles neptune in a retrograde orbit in under six days tidal forces on triton are causing it to spiral slowly towards the planet in 10 to 100 million years a short time in astronomical terms the moon will be so close that neptunian gravity will tear it apart forming a spectacular ring to accompany the planet s modest current rings triton s landscape is as strange and unexpected as those of io and miranda the moon has more rock than its counterparts at saturn and uranus triton s mantle is probably composed of water ice but the moon s crust is a thin veneer of nitrogen and methane the moon shows two dramatically different types of terrain the so called cantaloupe terrain and a receding ice cap dark streaks appear on the ice cap these streaks are the fallout from geyser like volcanic vents that shoot nitrogen gas and dark fine grained particles to heights of 2 to 8 kilometers 1 to 5 miles triton s thin atmosphere only 1 70 000th as thick as earth s has winds that carry the dark particles and deposit them as streaks on the ice cap the coldest surface yet found in the solar system 235 degrees celsius 391 degrees fahrenheit triton might be more like pluto than any other object spacecraft have so far visited pluto pluto is the most distant of the planets yet the eccentricity of its orbit periodically carries it inside neptune s orbit where it has been since 1979 and where it will remain until march 1999 pluto s orbit is also highly inclined tilted 17 degrees to the orbital plane of the other planets discovered in 1930 pluto appears to be little more than a celestial snowball the planet s diameter is calculated to be approximately 2 300 kilometers 1 430 miles only two thirds the size of our moon ground based observations indicate that pluto s surface is covered with methane ice and that there is a thin atmosphere that may freeze and fall to the surface as the planet moves away from the sun observations also show that pluto s spin axis is tipped by 122 degrees the planet has one known satellite charon discovered in 1978 charon s surface composition is different from pluto s the moon appears to be covered with water ice rather than methane ice its orbit is gravitationally locked with pluto so both bodies always keep the same hemisphere facing each other pluto s and charon s rotational period and charon s period of revolution are all 6 4 earth days although no spacecraft have ever visited pluto nasa is currently exploring the possibility of such a mission comets the outermost members of the solar system occasionally pay a visit to the inner planets as asteroids are the rocky and metallic remnants of the formation of the solar system comets are the icy debris from that dim beginning and can survive only far from the sun most comet nuclei reside in the oort cloud a loose swarm of objects in a halo beyond the planets and reaching perhaps halfway to the nearest star comet nuclei orbit in this frozen abyss until they are gravitationally perturbed into new orbits that carry them close to the sun as a nucleus falls inside the orbits of the outer planets the volatile elements of which it is made gradually warm by the time the nucleus enters the region of the inner planets these volatile elements are boiling the nucleus itself is irregular and only a few miles across and is made principally of water ice with methane and ammonia materials very similar to those composing the moons of the giant planets as these materials boil off of the nucleus they form a coma or cloud like head that can measure tens of thousands of kilometers across the coma grows as the comet gets closer to the sun the stream of charged particles coming from the sun pushes on this cloud blowing it back like a flag in the wind and giving rise to the comet s tails gases and ions are blown directly back from the nucleus but dust particles are pushed more slowly as the nucleus continues in its orbit the dust particles are left behind in a curved arc both the gas and dust tails point away from the sun in effect the comet chases its tails as it recedes from the sun the tails can reach 150 million kilometers 93 million miles in length but the total amount of material contained in this dramatic display would fit in an ordinary suitcase comets from the latin cometa meaning long haired are essentially dramatic light shows some comets pass through the solar system only once but others have their orbits gravitationally modified by a close encounter with one of the giant outer planets these latter visitors can enter closed elliptical orbits and repeatedly return to the inner solar system halley s comet is the most famous example of a relatively short period comet returning on an average of once every 76 years and orbiting from beyond neptune to within venus orbit confirmed sightings of the comet go back to 240 b c this regular visitor to our solar system is named for sir edmond halley because he plotted the comet s orbit and predicted its return based on earlier sightings and newtonian laws of motion his name became part of astronomical lore when in 1759 the comet returned on schedule unfortunately sir edmond did not live to see it a comet can be very prominent in the sky if it passes comparatively close to earth unfortunately on its most recent appearance halley s comet passed no closer than 62 4 million kilometers 38 8 million miles from our world the comet was visible to the naked eye especially for viewers in the southern hemisphere but it was not spectacular comets have been so bright on rare occasions that they were visible during daytime historically comet sightings have been interpreted as bad omens and have been artistically rendered as daggers in the sky the comet rendezvous asteroid flyby craf spacecraft will become the first traveler to fly close to a comet nucleus and remain in proximity to it as they both approach the sun craf will observe the nucleus as it becomes active in the growing sunlight and begins to have its lighter elements boil off and form a coma and tails several spacecraft have flown by comets at high speed the first was nasa s international cometary explorer in 1985 an armada of five spacecraft two japanese two soviet and the giotto spacecraft from the european space agency flew by halley s comet in 1986 conclusion despite their efforts to peer across the vast distances of space through an obscuring atmosphere scientists of the past had only one body they could study closely earth but since 1959 spaceflight through the solar system has lifted the veil on our neighbors in space we have learned more about our solar system and its members than anyone had in the previous thousands of years our automated spacecraft have traveled to the moon and to all the planets beyond our world except pluto they have observed moons as large as small planets flown by comets and sampled the solar environment astronomy books now include detailed pictures of bodies that were only smudges in the largest telescopes for generations we are lucky to be alive now to see these strange and beautiful places and objects the knowledge gained from our journeys through the solar system has redefined traditional earth sciences like geology and meteorology and spawned an entirely new discipline called comparative planetology by studying the geology of planets moons asteroids and comets and comparing differences and similarities we are learning more about the origin and history of these bodies and the solar system as a whole we are also gaining insight into earth s complex weather systems by seeing how weather is shaped on other worlds and by investigating the sun s activity and its influence throughout the solar system we can better understand climatic conditions and processes on earth we will continue to learn and benefit as our automated spacecraft explore our neighborhood in space one current mission is mapping venus others are flying between worlds and will reach the sun and jupiter after complex trajectory adjustments future missions are planned for mars saturn a comet and the asteroid belt we can also look forward to the time when humans will once again set foot on an alien world although astronauts have not been back to the moon since december 1972 plans are being formulated for our return to the lunar landscape and for the human exploration of mars and even the establishment of martian outposts one day taking a holiday may mean spending a week at a lunar base or a martian colony
