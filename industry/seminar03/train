1 | as the subject says can i use a 4052 for digital signals i don t see why it couldn t handle digital signals but i could be wrong anyone have any advice thanks the switches have a non negligable on resistance up to 1k ohm when powered by 5 volts and a maximum current and a maximum static voltage across switch not a good bet for ttl should work for cmos but slow things down a bit there are 74hc versions that have better specs but lower max voltage
2 | i am looking for current sources for lists of all the home medical tests currently legally available i believe this trend of allowing tests at home where feasible decreased medical costs by a factor of 10 or more and allows the patient some time and privacy to consider the best action from the results of such tests in fact i believe home medical tests and certain basic tests for serious diseases such as cancer heart disease should be offered free to the american public this could actually help to reduce national medical costs since many would have an earlier opportunity to know about and work toward recuperation or cure mike romano
2 | but why do you characterize this as a flight of fancy or a fantasy while i am unfamiliar with the scientific context here it appears obvious that his speculation for lack of a better or more neutral word was at least in significant part a consequence of his knowledge of and acceptance of current theory coupled with his observations it would appear that something quite rational was going on as he attempted to fit his observation into that theory or to tailor the theory to cover the observation this does not seem like an example of what most would normally call a flight of fancy or a fantasy well i think someone else in this thread was the first to use the word also extra scientific etc nor am i prepared to give a general account of rationality in terms of examples there is some danger of beginning to quibble over what a surprising experiment is what counts as surprising etc the same may be said about logical grounds my point is that quite frequently perhaps even most frequently the roots of a new theory can be traced to previously existing theories or even to previously rejected hypotheses of some other theory or domain i would offer some rather well known examples such as toricelli s puy de dome experiment done for the sake of his sea of air hypothesis was this theory and the resulting experimental test surprising well given the prior explanations of the phenomena involved it certainly must be counted as so was the theory constructed and the experiment designed out of perfectly rational grounds well there was a pretty successful and well know theory of fluids the analogy to fluids by toricelli is explicit the novelty was in thinking of air as a fluid but this was quite a novelty at the time was the theory interesting yes was it new well one could argue that it was merely the extension of an existing theory to a new domain but i think this begs certain questions we can debate that if you like
3 | it was more than a theoretical concept it was seriously pursued by freeman dyson et al many years ago i don t know how well known this is but a high explosive orion prototype flew in the atmosphere in san diego back in 1957 or 1958 i was working at general atomic at the time but i didn t learn about the experiment until almost thirty years later when ted taylor visited us and revealed that it had been done i feel sure that someone must have film of that experiment and i d really like to see it has anyone out there seen it

2 | i ve recently listened to a tape by dr stanislaw burzynski in which he claims to have discovered a series naturally occuring peptides with anti cancer properties that he names antineoplastons burzynski says that his work has met with hostility in the united states despite the favorable responses of his subjects during clinical trials what is the generally accepted opinion of dr burzynski s research he paints himself as a lone researcher with a new breakthrough battling an intolerant medical establishment but i have no basis from which to judge his claims two weeks ago however i read that the nih s department of alternative medicine has decided to focus their attention on burzynski s work their budget is so small that i imagine they wouldn t investigate a treatment that didn t seem promising any opinions on burzynski s antineoplastons or information about the current status of his research would be appreciated

3 | space station redesign leader says cost goal may be impossible today 4 6 the washington post ran an article with the headline shown above the article starts with a leader of the nasa team in charge of redesigning the planned space station said yesterday the job is tough and may be impossible o connor is quoted saying whether it is possible to cut costs that much and still provide for meaningful research is a real question for me o connor said everything is fair game including dropping or curtailing existing contracts with the aerospace industry chopping management of the space station program at some nasa facilities around the country working closely with the russian space station mir and using unmanned titan rockets to supplement the manned space shuttle fleet o connor says his team has reviewed 30 design options so far and they are sorting the serious candidates into three categories based on cost the post says o connor described the design derived from the current ssf as a high cost option i believe kathy sawyer the post writer got confused here i listened in on part of o connor s briefing to the press on monday and in one part of the briefing o connor talked about how the white house wants three options sorted by cost low medium and high in another part of the briefing he discussed the three teams he has formed to look at three options ssf derivative larc modular buildup with bus 1 msfc and single launch core wingless orbiter jsc later in response to a reporters question i thought i heard o connor say the option based on a ssf redesign was a moderate cost option in between low high cost options not the high cost option as sawyer wrote the article goes on to describe the other two options as one features modules that could gradually be fitted together in orbit similar to the russian mir the other is a core facility that could be deposited in orbit in a single launch like skylab that option would use existing hardware from the space shuttle the fuselage for example in its basic structure

2 | i hope gordon banks did not mean to imply that notions such as hard to see candida infections causing various problems should not be investigated many researchers have made breakthroughs by figuring out how to investigate things that were previously thought virtually impossible to test for indeed i would be surprised if candida overbloom were such a phenomena i would think that candida would produce signature byproducts whose measure would then set a lower bound on the extent of recent infection i realize this might get quite tricky and difficult probably expensive and likely inconvenient or uncomfortable to the subjects but that is not the same as virtually impossible

2 | great post martin very informative well balanced and humanitarian without neglecting the need for scientific rigor cross posted to alt psychology personality since some personality typing will be discussed at the beginning note i ve set all followups to sci med since most of my comments are more sci med oriented and i m sure most of the replies if any will be med related they are just responding in their natural way hyper choleric syndrome hcs oops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological community better not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist actually it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as nt for those not familiar with the myers briggs system just e mail me and i ll send a summary file to you in the general population nt s comprise only about 12 of the population but among physicians it is much much higher i don t know the exact percentage any help here a p p er s one driving characteristic of an nt especially an ntj is their obvious choleric behavior driver type a etc the extreme emotional need to control to lead and or to be the best or the most competent if they are also extroverted they are best described as field marshalls this trait is very valuable and essential in our society we need people who want to lead to strive to overcome the elements to seek and thirst for knowledge to raise the level of competency etc the great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision an n trait and scientifically minded approach t trait of the nt personality of course the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well however when the nt person has self image challenges the dark side of this personality type usually comes out which should be obvious to all a physician who is a strong nt and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business like lack of empathy or feeling and is very compelled to have total control over their patient the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question i ve known many m d s of this temperament and suffice to say i don t oblige them with a followup visit no matter how competent i think they are and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs to know the most to know it all maybe we need more nf doctor s enough on this subject let s move on to candida bloom you ve helped me already by your post of course i believe that i have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis but being the phlegmatic i am maybe i was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts let s all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent in my well described situation in prior posts i definitely was immune stressed blood tests showed my vitamin a levels were very low my sinuses were a mess no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged i also was on antibiotics 15 times in 4 years in the end even two weeks of ceftin did not work and i had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat scans mucus color won t get into the details and other symptoms three very traditional ent s made this diagnosis i did not have any cultures done however because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection enough of this background provided to help you understand where i was when i make comments about my sporanox anti fungal therapy below the first question i have is this can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without being considered systemic in the classic sense it is sort of an inbetween infection i was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin a my doctor after my blood tests put me on 75 000 iu of vitamin a for one week only then dropped it down to 25 000 iu for the next couple of weeks i also received zinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained he s one of those evil orthomolecular specialists i had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin a was normal he then stopped me on all vitamin a except for some in a multi vitamin supplement and made sure that i maintain a 50 000 iu day of beta carotene call me carrot face hopefully elaine s doctor will take a similar careful approach and to all supplements i m even reevaluating some supplements i m taking for example niacin in fairly large dosages 1 gram day which steve dyer had good information about on sci med nutrition if niacin only has second order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long term and risking liver damage though i do now believe based on my successful therapy with sporanox that i definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in my sinuses i still want to ask the question have there been any studies that demonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation sinusitis rhinitis my sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time i did not have any noticeable gi track problems before starting on sporanox but some for a few days after which then went away considered normal btw my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry can t remember which one and found an obscure comment dating back into the 1950 s which stated that people can develop contained non lethal or non serious aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms i ll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion my doctor tested me i believe a rast or rast similar test for allergic response to specificially candida albicans and i showed a strong positive another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless and assuming it is true that candida can grow part way into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy to candida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body s allergic response as i said in an earlier post one does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a m d degree or a ph d in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis btw and i ll repost this again dr ivker in his book sinus survival has routinely given before anything else nizoral a pre sporanox systemic anti fungal not as safe and not as good as sporanox to his new chronic sinusitis patients if they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years he claims that out of 2000 or so patients well over 90 notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but it doesn t cure it by any means implying the so called yeast fungus infection is not the primary cause but a later complication he s also found that nystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not help this implies of course assuming that excessive yeast fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeast fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast fungus other than by direct contact it is not absorbed into the blood stream again i admit lots of ifs and implies which doesn t please the hard core nt who has to have the double blind study or it s a non issue but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis explanation a strawman if you will this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until the appropriate studies are done and that is if you can t observe or culture the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then there s no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease and i know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body it s a real catch 22 another catch 22 those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say that no studies have been done actually studies have been done but if it s not up to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a non study which should not even be considered i agree that the appropriate studies should be done and that will take big to do it right however in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets you literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding that is you have to do 90 of the study before you even get funding as a scientist at a national lab i m very aware of this for the smaller funded projects i m afraid that even if dr ivker and 100 other doctors got together pooled their practice s case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would get nowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical results it is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have decided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non lethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenable hypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it s a done issue excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not will not and cannot exist period kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint kind of reminds me of lister aren t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia again the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast fungus species can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar to mold growing in bread you can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does but you can t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti fungal such as itraconazole sporanox or some of the older ones such as nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective this is why as has been pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor i ve been in e mail contact with thanks that nystatin is not effective in the long term treatment of gi tract candidiasis it s like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away the 60000 question is whether a contained candida bloom can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people e g allergy without becoming systemic in the classical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal also if one is an anal retentive like i ve been diagnosed in a prior post that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth as i ve said in private e mail there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies after the approved proven accepted therapies don t work for example i went to three ent s who all said that i will just have to live with my acute chronic sinusitis after the ab s failed they did mention surgery to open up the ostia but my ostia weren t plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition after three months of aggressive and fairly non standard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring and equalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc my health has vastly improved to where i was two years ago before my health greatly deteriorated of course skeptics would say that maybe if i did nothing i would have improved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ent s i saw who said that i d just have to live with it i m confident i will reach what one could call a total cure the anti fungal program i undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab s for the last four years note for those having sinus problems may i suggest the book by dr ivker i mention above be sure to get the revised edition dr ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and his visits to several ent s totally floored him when they said you ll just have to live with it he spent several years trying everything standard and non standard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis he now shares his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i am on the road to recovery following some parts of it his one recommendation to take a systemic anti fungal at the beginning of treatment if you have a history of anti biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice i m sure if i commented to him of the hard core beliefs of the anti yeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such as it s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildly i also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypothetical yeast overgrowth e g they fit some of the profiles the pro yeast people have identified should consider anti fungal therapy if all other avenues have been exhausted remember theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic if a doctor does something non standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients shouldn t you at least sit up and take notice maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn t work i m afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help you have to do both both have to be balanced which we don t see from some of the posters to this group there comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approach such as trying a good systemic anti fungal such as sporanox after having exhausted all the other avenues i was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help so i did the natural thing i went to a couple of doctor s who are somewhat outside this establishment and as a result i have found significant relief would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or having his license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubt therapies for his her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective i d like to hear a doctor tell me well i ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country and since they clearly don t work for you i now have the authority to use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others i can t promise anything and there are some risks you will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies and i ll have to register your case at the state board anyway if my ent had suggested this to me i would ve jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruistic reasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him her risk meaning losing their license and possibly to the patient such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free it also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient that it s doing everything it can within reason to help the patient it is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some of which seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at all true quackery i better get off my soapbox before this post reaches 500k in size what dosage of b6 appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper working of the mucos memebranes i d like to see the role of complex carbohydrates such as starch brave soul you are the venom on usenet can be quite toxic unless one develops an immunity to it one year ago my phlegmatic self would have backed down right away from an attack of cholericitis but my immune system and my computer system have been hardened from gradual desensitization i now kind of like being called anal retentive it has a nice ring to it i also was very impressed by how it just flowed into the post truly classic worthy of a blue or maybe brown ribbon i might even cross post it to alt best of internet hmmm thanks again for a great and

3 | reading from a amoco performance products data sheet their erl 1906 resin with t40 carbon fiber reinforcement has a compressive strength of 280 000 psi it has a density of 0 058 lb cu in therefore the theoretical height for a constant section column that can just support itself is 4 8 million inches or 400 000 ft or 75 statute miles now a real structure will have horizontal bracing either a truss type or guy wires or both and will be used below the crush strength let us assume that we will operate at 40 of the theoretical strength this gives a working height of 30 miles for a constant section column a constant section column is not the limit on how high you can build something if you allow a tapering of the cross section as you go up for example let us say you have a 280 000 pound load to support at the top of the tower for simplicity in calculation this requires 2 5 square inches of column cross sectional area to support the weight the mile of structure below the payload will itself weigh 9 200 lb so at 1 mile below the payload the total load is now 289 200 lb a 3 3 increase the next mile of structure must be 3 3 thicker in cross section to support the top mile of tower plus the payload each mile of structure must increase in area by the same ratio all the way to the bottom we can see from this that there is no theoretical limit on area although there will be practical limits based on how much composites we can afford to by at 40 lb and how much load you need to support on the ground for which you need a foundation that the bedrock can support let us arbitrarily choose 1 billion as the limit in costruction cost with this we can afford perhaps 10 000 000 lb of composites assuming our finished structure costs 100 lb the 40 lb figure is just for materials cost then we have a tower payload mass ratio of 35 7 1 at a 3 3 mass ratio per mile the tower height becomes 111 miles this is clearly above the significant atmosphere a rocket launched from the top of the tower will still have to provide orbital velocity but atmospheric drag and g losses will be almost eliminated g losses are the component of rocket thrust in the vertical direction to counter gravity but which do not contribute to horizontal orbital velocity thus they represent wasted thrust together with drag rockets starting from the ground have a 15 velocity penalty to contend with this analysis is simplified in that it does not consider wind loads these will require more structural support over the first 15 miles of height above that the air pressure drops to a low enough value for it not to be a big factor dani eder

1 | i ve found this works pretty well on noisy laminated power transformer cores and windings the 60hz kind likewise if anybody has tried this on a flyback i d like to hear about it i would suspect it would not be as effective as it was on power transformers as the material wouldn t damp as well something i suspect would be critical at the frequencies involved in other words you want absorption rather than prevention which would be real difficult at 15 khz dave medin phone 205 730 3169 w ssd networking 205 837 1174 h intergraph corp m s gd3004 internet dtmedin catbyte b30 ingr com huntsville al 35894 uucp uunet ingr b30 catbyte dtmedin everywhere you look at least around my office

be welcome sources nasa fact sheets cassini mission design team isas nasda launch schedules press kits asuka astro d isas japan x ray astronomy satellite launched into earth orbit on 2 20 93 equipped with large area wide wavelength 1 20 angstrom x ray telescope x ray ccd cameras and imaging gas scintillation proportional counters cassini saturn orbiter and titan atmosphere probe cassini is a joint nasa esa project designed to accomplish an exploration of the saturnian system with its cassini saturn orbiter and huygens titan probe cassini is scheduled for launch aboard a titan iv centaur in october of 1997 after gravity assists of venus earth and jupiter in a vvejga trajectory the spacecraft will arrive at saturn in june of 2004 upon arrival the cassini spacecraft performs several maneuvers to achieve an orbit around saturn near the end of this initial orbit the huygens probe separates from the orbiter and descends through the atmosphere of titan the orbiter relays the probe data to earth for about 3 hours while the probe enters and traverses the cloudy atmosphere to the surface after the completion of the probe mission the orbiter continues touring the saturnian system for three and a half years titan synchronous orbit trajectories will allow about 35 flybys of titan and targeted flybys of iapetus dione and enceladus the objectives of the mission are threefold conduct detailed studies of saturn s atmosphere rings and magnetosphere conduct close up studies of saturn s satellites and characterize titan s atmosphere and surface one of the most intriguing aspects of titan is the possibility that its surface may be covered in part with lakes of liquid hydrocarbons that result from photochemical processes in its upper atmosphere these hydrocarbons condense to form a global smog layer and eventually rain down onto the surface the cassini orbiter will use onboard radar to peer through titan s clouds and determine if there is liquid on the surface experiments aboard both the orbiter and the entry probe will investigate the chemical processes that produce this unique atmosphere the cassini mission is named for jean dominique cassini 1625 1712 the first director of the paris observatory who discovered several of saturn s satellites and the major division in its rings the titan atmospheric entry probe is named for the dutch physicist christiaan huygens 1629 1695 who discovered titan and first described the true nature of saturn s rings key scheduled dates for the cassini mission vvejga trajectory 10 06 97 titan iv centaur launch

understanding of global ocean dynamics the satellite also will increase understanding of how heat is transported in the ocean ulysses european space agency probe to study the sun from an orbit over its poles launched in late 1990 it carries particles and fields experiments such as magnetometer ion and electron collectors for various energy ranges plasma wave radio receivers etc but no camera since no human built rocket is hefty enough to send ulysses far out of the ecliptic plane it went to jupiter instead and stole energy from that planet by sliding over jupiter s north pole in a gravity assist manuver in february 1992 this bent its path into a solar orbit tilted about 85 degrees to the ecliptic it will pass over the sun s south pole in the summer of 1993 its aphelion is 5 2 au and surprisingly its perihelion is about 1 5 au that s right a solar studies spacecraft that s always further from the sun than the earth is while in jupiter s neigborhood ulysses studied the magnetic and

1 | i don t want to get into a semantic argument but contrary to some other postings near uv light is actual uv light the near means that it is close to the visible spectrum i e of relatively long wavelength not that it is nearly uv i m sure you can figure out now just what far uv is regular incandenscent flashlight bulbs emit tiny amounts of uv in the near end of the spectrum such that a filter can be used to remove the visible light and thus create a weak uv source stronger sources are going to require gas probably mercury vapor discharge tubes such as fluorescent tubes with uv phosphor be careful though strong uv sources can cause physiological damage especially to the eyes the shorter wavelengths are the most dangerous it wouldn t project a beam like a flashlight but replacing the tubes in a portable fluorescent lantern with uv tubes would be a relatively cheap way to create a portable source it would be bright enough to be useful but not dangerously so
2 | and good grief has no one ever heard of biostatistics the university of washington plus 3 or 4 others harvard unc has a department and advanced degree program in biostatistics my wife has an ms biostat and there are plenty of mds phds and postdocs doing biostatistical work people do this for a living really bright people study for decades to do this sort of study well anecedotal evidence is worthless even doctors who have been using a drug or treatment for years and who swear it is effective are often suprised at the results of clinical trials whether or not msg causes describable reportable documentable symptoms should be pretty simple to discover the last study on which my wife worked employed 200 nurses 100 doctors and a dozen ph ds at one university and at 70 hospitals in five nations i would think the msg question could be settled by one lowly biostat ms student in a thesis
2 | am i justified in being pissed off at this doctor last saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife i took him to a local urgent and general care clinic at 5 50 pm the story deleted be bothered my son did get three stitches at the emergency room i m still trying to find out who is in charge of that clinic so i can write them a letter we will certainly never set foot in that clinic again the people in charge already know what kind of care they are providing and they don t give a rat s ass about your repeat business you are much more likely to do some good writing to local newspapers and broadcast news shows if you do keep the letter short and to the point so they don t discard it out of hand and emphasize exactly what you are upset about it s possible that the local health department can help you complain to someone official but really that clinic exists for the sole purpose of generating walk in income through advertising and nothing you can do will change them all you can hope for is to help someone else avoid them i m glad it sounds like your son did ok anyway

3 | and one of my profs is the chief engineer for the project dr ron humble univ colorado at colorado springs i love the idea of an inflatable 1 mile long sign it will be a really neat thing to see it explode when a bolt or even better a westford needle comes crashing into it at 10 clicks a sec boom whooooooooshhhhhh sputter sputter okay pretend it would make a sound i hear insert favorite rumor here that it will supposedly coincide with the atlanta olympics
3 | the japanese are still on the learning curve as far as nuclear power goes this means that unlike the germans who do great things all by themselves the japanese tie up with foreign companies the major one is mitsubishi who else who have a sharing agreement with ge i think no chance of a new design sodium has lots of chemical problems like it eats stainless steel very slowly but it gets there in the end not what i call a desired property as for design difficulties what does sodium do there it is a bitch and it is only its chemical properties flwed though they are that means it gets used two loops that s not a design problem isolation from air and water that doesn t cause design problems in comparison bwr s a dream rides don t get none of that in a liquid sodium breeder more steel more complexity joseph askew

1 | i had the insturment panel go out in my car a 1990 lincoln contenintal which is a digital dash they replaced the whole thing with a 1991 dash thank god it was under the warrenty anyway the odometer was reading the exact milage from the old panel it must have a eeprom of some sort in it that is up dated seems to me that removing the battery would erase it but it doesn t so i guess they swapped the nvm chip non volitile memory and installed it in the new dash no they wouldn t let me have the old dash to tinker with
2 | it would be nice to think that individuals can somehow beat the system and like a space explorer boldly go where no man has gone before and return with a prize cure unfortunately too often the prize is limited and the efficacy of the cure questionable when applied to all sufferers this applies to both medical researchers and non medical individuals just because it appears in an obscure journal and may be of some use does not make the next cure all what about the dozens of individuals who have courageously participated in clinical trials did they have any guarentee of cures are they any less because they didn t trumpet their story all over the world as a parting note wasn t there some studies done on gingko seeds for meniere s to the original poster what about trying for a trial of that it s probably not a final answer but it certainly may alleviate some of the discomfort and you d be helping answer the question for future sufferers
1 | i have notice a lot of electronics questions by people who are obviously not tuned in to electronics many of them have rather simple answers and many of them require a circuit diagram rather than muck up the network why don t you write to me send a self addressed stamped envelop and i ll answer your questions if i can

1 | just a few comments about the feasability of zipping up a bunch of miles on your electronic odometer with an oscillator i wouldn t expect to be able to do this not because the engineers at bmw are putting in anti fraud logic but just because an automobile is a noisy hostile environment for electronics and i would expect the software to be conservative if i were to design a microprocessor based odometer speedometer program it would have the following features just off the top of my head debouncing deglitching is this a real pulse or just a glitch smoothing the rate of change of speed cannot be too high this is a car not an electron top speed limit anything above 200mph is ridiculous must be electrical noise or contact bounce as for getting in and presetting the pins if this is the circuit board out of a bmw dashboard i seem to remember a single big chip with lotsa pins in the middle of the card good luck getting at the counter i wouldn t expect a high input frequency to damage the meter remember it s probably damped so it can t move too fast and is probably protected after all a car is an extremely hostile place for delicate electronics there used to be an app note in the national semiconductor linear databook that went into this in good detail jerry kaidor tr2 jerry dragoman com jkaidor synoptics com
2 | i was there in 1976 i suppose it must have died out since 1946 then certainly i never heard of any homeopaths or herbalists in the employ of the nhs perhaps the law codified it but the authorities refused to hire any homeopaths a similar law in the us allows chiropractors to practice in va hospitals but i ve never seen one there and i don t know of a single va that has hired a chiropractor there are a lot of britons on the net so someone should be able to tell us if the nhs provides homeopaths for you gordon banks n3jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb cadre dsl pitt edu it is shameful to surrender it too soon

1 | well i m not too sure if this would be the right place to post this but anyway here goes i was just noticing that some of the current bubblejet printers offers up to 360x360 resolution while a lot of lower end laser printers only offer 300x300 however the laser printers still seems to be significantly pricier than the bubblejets how is this or am i missing something about the resolution thing
1 | i need a small battery powered hi voltage capacitive discharge supply to deliver 6 joules at 250 volts this implies a 200uf cap i have built a very satisfactorily operating version from a max641 but do not like the idea of using a 6 single source part it seems that the ubiquitous camera flash circuit is what i want but i cant get mine apart without breaking it i would appreciate receiving the circuit description or a source of one i have already looked in several electronics circuits handbooks to no avail thanx

1 | good point also i wouldn t be surprised that the components they use off shore are of inferior quality as long as it was properly designed and robust premium components are used it shouldn t matter where it is assembled an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it s gonna sound the amp you have probably is running class a the whole day actually i d be wary of excessively hot amps cauz even though the components inside may be rated to run that way excessive heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component regardless of quality in fact an amp that does run hot to the touch is because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs hmmmmm aaron

3 | announce that a reward of 1 billion would go to the first corporation who successfully keeps at least 1 person alive on the moon for a year and with 1b on offer the problem of keeping them alive is highly likely to involve more than just the lunar environment oh dear my freighter just landed on the roof of acme s base and they all died how sad gosh that leaves us as the oldest residents quick boss the slime from yoyodyne are back and this time they ve got a tank man the guns one could imagine all sorts of technologies being developed in that sort of environment greg i m kidding btw although the problem of winner takes all prizes is that it encourages all sorts of undesirable behaviour witness military procurement programs and 1b is probably far too small a reward to encourage what would be a very expensive and high risk proposition

1 | this is indeed one function but more sophisticated ones do level control and ground lift separating the keyboard and mixer earths aswell simple ones are just that a transformer a decent quality audio trans former will cost most of that 50 they are wired thus hot hot input from balanced out to mixer keyboard cold gnd gnd the ground lift switch disconnects the gnd line from the mixer the transformer ratio depends on the precise application but around 10 1 turns ratio may be a good place to start christopher

2 | a friend has the following symptoms which have occurred periodically every few months for the last 3 years an episode begins with extreme tiredness followed by 1 traveling joint pains and stiffness affecting mostly the elbows knees and hips 2 generalized muscle pains 3 tinnitus and a feeling of pressure in her ears 4 severe sweating occuring both at night and during the day 5 hemorrhaging in both eyes her opthamologist calls it peripheral retinal hemorhages and says it looks similar to diabetic retinopathy she isn t diabetic they checked 6 distorted color vision and distorted vision in general telephone poles do not appear to be straight 7 loss of peripheral vision many tests have been run and all are normal except for something called unidentified bright objects found on a mri of her brain the only thing that seems to alleviate one of these episodes is prednisone at times she had been on 60 mg per day whenever she gets down to 10 15 mg the symptoms become acute again
2 | hello to everybody i write here because i am kind of desperate for about six weeks i ve been suffering on pains in my left head side the left leg and sometimes the left arm i made many tests e g computer tomography negative lyme borreliosis negative all electrolytes in the blood in their correct range they re all o k so i should be healthy as a matter of fact i am not feeling so i was also at a neurologist s too he considered me healthy too the blood tests have shown that i have little too much of hemoglobin 17 5 common range is 14 to 17 i unfortunately do not know about the units could these hemi sided pains be the result of this or of a also possible block of the neck muscles i have no fever and i am not feeling entirely sick but neither entirely healthy please answer by direct email on ghilardi urz unibas ch thanks for every hint

3 | tom s right about this it s only a grantable right if the granter has the will and the ability to stop anyone from taking it away from you never mind the legal status nick s right about this it s always easier to obtain forgiveness than permission not many people remember that britain s king george iii expressly forbid his american subjects to cross the alleghany appalachian mountains said subjects basically said stop us if you can he couldn t that s how the usa started of course that s also how the bolivarian republic started ca 1800 1820 in central america it didn t have quite the staying power of the usa i m sure there are more examples of going far away and then ignoring authority but none jump to mind right now or do as some whaling nations do define whatever activities you want to carry out as scientific research which just coincidentally requires the recovery of megatonnes of minerals or whatever then go at it lute keyser had just this sort of arrangement with libya i think in the late 70 s for his commercial space launch project one of the very earliest it was killed by soviet propaganda about nato cruise missiles in africa which made libya renege on the arrangement
3 | if i read you right you re saying in essence that with a larger economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste on a lunar facility that was certainly partially the case with apollo but real lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military scientific or commercial reason for being rather than just a we have the money why not approach it s conceivable that luna will have a military purpose it s possible that luna will have a commercial purpose but it s most likely that luna will only have a scientific purpose for the next several hundred years at least therefore lunar bases should be predicated on funding levels little different from those found for antarctic bases can you put a 200 person base on the moon for 30 million a year even if you use grad students gary

2 | while in grad school i remember a biochemistry friend of mine working with heat shock proteins apparently burning protein will induce changes in he dna whether these changes survive the denaturing that occurs during digestion i don t know but i never eat burnt food because of this also many woods contain toxins as they are burnt it would seem logical that some may volatilise and get into the bbqed food again i don t know if these toxins antifungal and anti woodeater compounds would survive the rather harsh conditions of the stomach and intestine and then would they be able to cross the intestinal mucosa maybe someone with more biochemical background than myself which is almost anyone can shed some light on heat shock proteins and the toxins that may be in the wood used to make charcoal and bbq

1 | here is a different viewpoint in practice there is little difference in quality but more care is needed with inkjet because smudges etc can happen a cheap laser printer does not manage that sort of throughput and on top of that how long does the _first_ sheet take to print inkjets are faster than you say and in both cases the computer often has trouble keeping up with the printer i have a 486 33 and a lot of drivers cannot keep up with the printer a sage said to me do you want one copy or lots of copies one inkjet paper cost is the same and both can use refills long term the laserprinter will need some expensive replacement parts consumables and on top of that are the amortisation costs which favour the lowest purchase cost printer hp inkjets understand pcl so in many cases a laserjet driver will work if the software package has no inkjet driver there is one wild difference between the two printers a laserprinter is a page printer whilst an inkjet is a line printer this means that a laserprinter can rotate graphic images whilst an inkjet cannot few drivers actually use this facility there is also the matter of downloadable fonts and so on

2 | in the september 1992 issue of the tufts university diet and nutrition letter there is a three page article about artificial sweeteners what follows are those excerpts which deal specifically with nutrasweet reproduced without permission the controversy over aspartame began six years ago in england where a group of researchers found that aspartame marketed under the tradename nutrasweet appears to stimulate appetite and presumably the eating of more calories in the long run than if a person simply consumed sugar when researchers asked a group of 95 people to drink plain water aspartame sweetened water and sugared water they said that overall they felt hungriest after drinking the artificially sweetened beverage the study received widespread media attention and stirred a good deal of concern among the artificial sweetener using public however its results were questionable at best since the researchers did not go on to measure whether the increase in appetite did actually translate into an increase in eating the two do not necessarily go hand in hand in the years that followed more than a dozen studies examining the effect of aspartame on appetite and eating were conducted and after reviewing every one of them the director of the laboratory of the study of human ingestive behavior at johns hopkins university barbara rolls ph d concluded that consuming aspartame sweetened foods and drinks is not associated with any increase in the amount of food eaten afterward one artificial sweetener that is not typically accused of causing cancer is aspartame but it most certainly has been blamed for a host of other ills since its introduction in 1981 the government has received thousands of complaints accusing it of causing everything from headaches to nausea to mood swings to anxiety still years of careful scientific study conducted both before and after the sweetener s entering the market have failed to confirm that it can bring about adverse health effects that s why the centers for disease control the government agency charged with monitoring public health the american medical association s council on scientific affairs and the food and drug administration have given aspartame one of the most studied food additives a clean bill of health granted the fda has set forth an acceptable daily intake of 50 milligrams of aspartame per kilogram of body weight to exceed the limit however a 120 pound 55 kg woman would have to take in 2 750 milligrams of aspartame the amount in 15 cans of aspartame sweetened soda pop 14 cups of gelatin 22 cups of yogurt or 55 six ounce servings of aspartame containing hot cocoa a 175 pound 80 kg man would have to consume some 4 000 milligrams of the sweetener the amount in 22 cans of soda pop or 32 cups of yogurt to go over the limit chart with aspartame content of selected foods omitted only one small group of people must be certain to stay away from aspartame those born with a rare metabolic disorder called phenylketonuria or pku the estimated one person in every 12 000 to 15 000 who has it is unable to properly metabolize an essential amino acid in aspartame called phenylalanine once a child consumes it it builds up in the body and can ultimately cause such severe problems as mental retardation to help people with pku avoid the substance labels on cans of soda pop and other aspartame sweetened foods must carry the warning phenylketonurics contains phenylalanine

increased 19 9 from 1991 to 1992 after declining steadily during the 1980s in comparison in the united states reported cases of gonorrhea in 1992 continued an overall decreasing trend 1 this report summarizes an analysis of the increase in gonorrhea in colorado in 1992 and characterizes trends in the occurrence of this disease from 1985 through 1992 in 1992 4679 cases of gonorrhea were reported to the colorado department of health cdh compared with 3901 cases reported in 1991 during 1992 reported cases increased 22 7 and 17 5 among females and males respectively table 1 similar increases occurred among blacks whites and hispanics 15 6 15 1 and 15 9 respectively however the number of reported cases with race not specified increased 88 from 1991 to 1992 and constituted 9 7 of all reported cases in 1992 although the largest proportional increases by age groups occurred among persons aged 35 44 years 80 4 and greater than or equal to 45 years 87 7 these age groups accounted for only 11 0 of all reported cases in 1992 persons in the 15 19 year age group accounted for the largest number of reported cases of gonorrhea during 1992 and the highest age group specific rate 639 per 100 000 reported cases of gonorrhea increased 32 9 in the five county denver metropolitan area 1990 population 1 629 466 but decreased elsewhere in the state table 1 half the cases of gonorrhea in the denver metropolitan area occurred in 8 4 34 of the census tracts these represent neighborhoods considered by sexually transmitted diseases stds acquired immunodeficiency syndrome aids field staff to be the focus of gang and drug activity when compared with 1991 the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed among men in the denver metro health clinic dmhc the primary public std clinic in the denver metropolitan area increased 33 in 1992 and the number of visits by males to the clinic increased 2 4 concurrently the number of cases diagnosed among women increased by 1 among self identified heterosexual men the number of gonorrhea cases diagnosed at dmhc increased 33 and comprised 94 of all cases diagnosed in males while the number of cases diagnosed among self identified homosexual men remained low 71 and 74 in 1991 and 1992 respectively four selected laboratories in the metropolitan denver area i e hmo university hospital nonprofit family planning and commercial were contacted to determine whether gonorrhea culture positivity rates increased gonorrhea culture positivity rates in three of four laboratories contacted increased 23 33 from 1991 to 1992 while the rate was virtually unchanged in the fourth i e nonprofit family planning from 1985 through 1991 reported cases of gonorrhea among whites and hispanics in colorado decreased in comparison reported cases among blacks hicnet medical newsletter page 14 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 increased since 1988 figure 1 during 1988 1992 the population in colorado increased 9 9 for blacks 9 8 for hispanics and 4 5 for whites in 1992 the gonorrhea rate for blacks 1935 per 100 000 persons was 57 times that for whites 34 per 100 000 and 12 times that for hispanics 156 per 100 000 table 1 among black females reported cases of gonorrhea increased from 1988 through 1992 in the 15 19 year age group among black males cases increased from 1989 through 1992 in both the 15 19 and 20 24 year age groups reported by ka gershman md jm finn ne spencer msph std aids program re hoffman md state epidemiologist colorado dept of health jm douglas md denver dept of health and hospitals surveillance and information systems br div of sexually transmitted diseases and hiv prevention national center for prevention svcs cdc editorial note the increase in reported gonorrhea cases in colorado in 1992 may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by cdh surveillance staff during 1991 1992 the increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at dmhc and in culture positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact however the stable culture positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory which serves a network of clinics statewide indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang and drug related sexual behavior as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug resistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs 2 although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requires further assessment to examine the possible role of drug use implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis 3 6 the cdh std aids program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use exchange of sex for money or drugs and gang affiliation the gonorrhea rate for blacks in colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year 2000 1300 per 100 000 objective 19 1a 7 race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other stds risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for stds and for targeting prevention efforts moreover race specific variation in std rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status access to medical care and high risk behaviors in response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado interventions initiated by the cdh std aids program include 1 targeting partner notification in the denver metropolitan area to persons in groups at increased risk e g 15 19 year old black females and 20 24 year old black males 2 implementing a media campaign e g public service radio hicnet medical newsletter page 15 volume 6 number 10 april 20

and 1989 source mmwr 42 14 date apr 16 1993 motor vehicle crashes are the leading cause of death among children and young adults in the united states and account for more than 1 million years of potential life lost before age 65 annually 1 child safety seats and safety belts can substantially reduce this loss 2 from 1977 through 1985 all 50 states passed legislation requiring the use of child safety seats or safety belts for children although these laws reduce injuries to young children by an estimated 8 59 3 4 motor vehicle crash related injuries remain a major cause of disability and death among u s children 1 while the use of occupant restraints among children decreases inversely with age 84 usage for those aged 0 4 years 57 aged 5 11 years and 29 aged 12 18 years 5 in addition parents who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to use restraints for their children 6 to characterize the association between adult safety belt use and adult reported consistent use of occupant restraints for the youngest child aged less than 11 years within a household cdc analyzed data obtained from the behavioral risk factor surveillance system brfss during 1988 and 1989 this report summarizes the findings from this study data were available for 20 905 respondents aged greater than or equal to 18 years in 11 states that participated in brfss a population based random digit dialed telephone survey and administered a standard injury control and child safety module developed by cdc of these respondents 5499 26 had a child aged less than 11 years in their household each respondent was asked to specify the child s age and the frequency of restraint use for that child the two categories of child restraint and adult safety belt use in this analysis were 1 consistent use i e always buckle up and 2 less than consistent use i e almost always sometimes rarely or never buckle up data were weighted to provide estimates representative of each state software for survey data analysis sudaan 7 was used to calculate point estimates and confidence intervals statistically significant differences were defined by p values of less than 0 05 each of the 11 states had some type of child restraint law of these six arizona kentucky maine nebraska rhode island and west virginia had no law requiring adults to use safety belts four idaho maryland pennsylvania and washington had a secondary enforcement mandatory safety belt law i e a vehicle had to be stopped for a traffic violation before a citation for nonuse of safety belts could be issued and one state new york had a primary enforcement mandatory safety belt law i e vehicles could be stopped for a safety belt law violation alone in nine states child passenger protection hicnet medical newsletter page 17 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 laws included all children aged less than 5 years but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use the analysis in this report subgrouped states into 1 those having a law requiring adult safety belt use law states and 2 those without such a law no law states overall 21 of children aged less than 11 years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher p less than 0 05 chi square test in law states than in no law states 81 1 versus 74 3 and 58 7 versus 43 2 respectively high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to 1 year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety belt use figure 1 adults with consistent use reported high rates of child occupant restraint use regardless of the child s age range 95 5 for 1 year olds to 84 7 for 10 year olds in comparison for adults reporting less than consistent safety belt use the rate of child occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child range 93 1 for 1 year olds to 28 8 for 10 year olds when comparing children of consistent adult safety belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety belt users 95 confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups i e aged less than 1 and 1 year reported child occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no law states regardless of age of child table 1 in addition higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety belt use 8 reported by national center for injury prevention and control national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc editorial note the findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children 6 9 because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk taking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor vehicle injury 10 educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report accordingly occupant protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status such programs should be offered to adults through health care facilities that serve low income communities or through federal programs i e head start that are directed at parents with young children injury prevention programs emphasize restraining young children in addition however efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as hicnet medical newsletter page 18 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 they become older parents especially those with low educational attainment those who do not consistently wear safety belts and those from states that do not have mandatory safety belt use laws should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts finally the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers the age group characterized by the lowest rate of safety belt use and the highest rate of fatal crashes 5 references 1 cdc childhood

surveillance systems to monitor the birth prevalence of major defects reporting period covered this report covers birth defects surveillance in metropolitan atlanta georgia and selected jurisdictions in california for the years 1983 1988 description of system the california birth defects monitoring program and the metropolitan atlanta congenital defects program are two population based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods the prevalence estimates for 44 diagnostic categories were based on data for 1983 1988 for 639 837 births in california and 152 970 births in metropolitan atlanta the prevalences in the two areas were compared adjusting for race sex and maternal age by using poisson regression results regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis fetal alcohol syndrome hip dislocation dysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the kidney ureter and scoliosis lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability however differences in the prevalences of arm hand limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy 21 down syndrome are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy 21 and spina bifida however the reason for differences in arm hand reduction is unknown but may be related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene pool or random variation actions taken because of the similarities of these data bases several collaborative studies are being implemented in particular the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus attention on the impact of prenatal

1988 89 problem condition cdc monitors the emergence and spread of new influenza virus variants and the impact of influenza on morbidity and mortality annually from october through may reporting period covered this report covers u s influenza surveillance conducted from october 1988 through may 1989 description of system weekly reports from the vital statistics offices of 121 cities provided an index of influenza s impact on mortality 58 who collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza viruses weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and territorial epidemiologists and from 153 sentinel family practice physicians nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year results during the 1988 89 influenza season influenza a h1n1 and b viruses were identified in the united states with essentially equal frequency overall although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza a h1n1 predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza b predominated only 7 of identified viruses were influenza a h3n2 but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned and it subsequently predominated during the 1989 90 season during the 1988 89 season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza b and a h3n2 but not influenza a h1n1 interpretation the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains a h1n1 and b during the 1988 89 season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza a actions taken weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine cdc s annual surveillance allows the observed viral variants to be assessed as candidates for inclusion as components in vaccines used in subsequent influenza seasons authors louisa e

success procedures included are o in vitro o fertilization embryo transfer ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o gift cryopreservation of human embryos and gamete micromanipulation this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies hicnet medical newsletter page 24 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 future areas of research in addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the management of infertile couples we are developing the technology to assist couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary disease this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification by other centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the x chromosome the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex linked disorders the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birth of affected children catherine racowsky ph d associate professor and director of research department of obstetrics and gynecology college of medicine university of arizona tucson arizona applications success rates and advances for the management of infertility the following are the art procedures available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility in vitro fertilization embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our assisted reproduction program this procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and the culture of resultant embryos for 1 or 2 days before they are transferred to the patient s uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before being processed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer hicnet medical newsletter page 25 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 assisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform ivf et or indeed gift follicular development is typically stimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse and or gnrh analogues lupron depo lupron synarel occasionally however ivf et is accomplished with eggs obtained in non stimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound guided retrieval in our infertility unit with the patient sedated couples who resort to ivf et exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis and or mild forms of male factor infertility according to the united states ivf registry the overall success rate for ivf et nationwide has stabilized at about 14 percent per cycle results from our program involving 86 patients who have undergone 173 ivf et cycles reflect a comparable success rate nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivf et cycle attempts however among these age is the single most significant determinant of conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that 1 the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age 2 fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over 40 years and 3 provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our center therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age we have determined that more than 50 percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy gift this high tech art procedure is performed in the operating room usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivf et involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian tube an average of 3 eggs tube under these circumstances fertilization occurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivf with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases in hicnet medical newsletter page 26 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility and or idiopathic infertility the data reported in the united states ivf registry for 1985 through 1990 indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained with the ivf et technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is 24 to 36 percent and for ivf et 14 to 18 percent in view of this fact one might expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivf et however in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which while substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit the patient these concerns are 1 the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room 2 the risks albeit minimal of undergoing general anesthesia and 3 the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs and the developmental competency of resultant embryos the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the ivf et procedure between january 1 1991 and december 31 1992 we have performed a total of 12 gift cycles with an overall success rate of 20 percent embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program when embryos result from residual gift eggs or from non transferred ivf embryos this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulated by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs from both a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete micromanipulation this art procedure which is still very new is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility less than 10 million sperm ml in combination with fewer than 20 perccent motile sperm and or less than 10 percent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing the procedure of sub zonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion available data from szi programs world wide indicate that only 5 to 10 percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception catherine racowsky ph d hicnet medical newsletter page

2 | i need advice with a situation which occurred between me and a physican which upset me i saw this doctor for a problem with recurring pain he suggested medication and a course of treatment and told me that i need to call him 7 days after i begin the medication so that he may monitor its effectiveness as well as my general health i did exactly as he asked and made the call reaching his secretary i explained to her that i was following up at the doctor s request and that i was worried because the pain episodes were becoming more frequent and the medication did not seem effective the doctor called me back and his first words were whatever you want you d better make it quick i m very busy and don t have time to chit chat with you i told him i was simply following his instructions to call on the 7th day to status him and that i was feeling worse i then asked if perhaps there was a better time for us to talk when he had more time he responded just spit it out now because no time is a good time said in a raised voice i started to feel upset and tried to explain quickly what was going on with my condition but my nervousness interfered with my choice of words and i kind of stuttered and then said well never mind and he said he ll talk to various colleagues about other medications and he ll call me some other time this doctor called me that evening and said because i didn t express myself well he was confused about what i wanted at this point i was pretty upset and i told him in an amazingly polite voice considering how angry i felt that his earlier manner had hurt my feelings he told me that he just doesn t have time to rap with patients and thought that was what i wanted i told him that to assume i was calling to rap was insulting and said again that i was just following through on his orders he responded that he resented the implication that he felt i was making that he was not interested in learning about what his patients have to say about their condition status he then gave me this apology i am sorry that there was a miscommunication and you mistakenly thought i was insulting i am not trying to insult you but i am not that knowledgeable about pain and i don t have a lot of time to deal with that he then told me to call him the next day for further instructions on how do deal with my pain and medication i am still upset and have not yet called my questions 1 should i continue to have this doctor manage my care 2 since i am in pain off and on i realize that this may cause me to be more anxietous so am i perhaps over reacting or overly sensitive if this doctor refers me to his colleague who knows more about the type of pain i have he still wants me to status him on my condition but now i am afraid to call him

2 | i know that the placebo effect is where a patient feels better or even gets better because of his her belief in the medicine and the doctor administering it is there also an anti placebo effect where the patient dislikes distrusts doctors and medicine and therefore doesn t get better or feel better in spite of the medicine is there an effect where the doctor believes so strongly in a medicine that he she sees improvement where the is none or sees more improvement than there is if so what is this effect called is there a reverse of the above effect where the doctor doesn t believe in a medicine and then sees less improvement than there is what would this effect be called have these effects ever been studied how common are these effects thank you in advance for all replies

1 | anyway over the weekend i was resting on the sofa in between chores and noticed that i briefly picked up what sounded like ham radio traffic over my stereo and television even though both were off also all the touch sensitive lights in my house start going wacko cycling through their four brightness states i presume that some ham operator with an illegal amplifier drove past my house i live on a busy thoroughfare would this be a correct presumption what kind of power must he be putting out to cause the effects the affected equipment is about 100 feet from the road hams are unlikely to have an illegal amp and are also unlikely to have a dirty amp hams can legally run up to 1500 watts it is very unlikely however that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car ham rigs not possible either you d need about a 300 amp alternator for just the amplifier i can just see it you need to slow down on a downgrade so you hit the push to talk button for cars put out around 100 watts it is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet away most tvs stereos and vcrs have very poor rf shielding if you experience the problem frequently it may be caused by a ham cber or other radio operator in a base station nearby the interference may have been caused by a radio transmitter used for other purposes such as police fire etc if you heard voices over your stereo i think you are correct in assuming that the source is an rf transmitter if you have frequent trouble you may want to try the rf ferrite chokes available at radio shack the interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily without cutting them good instructions are included with the chokes if that does not solve the problem you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator look for antennas on the roof or car talk to him her about your problem there are things a radio operator can do to reduce interference and please remember to be friendly when approaching your local radio operator this person may or may not be the cause of your troubles and you ll get better cooperation and help if you assume that he is going to be helpful most are it was amazing the accusations that we sometimes dealt with as i grew up we were blamed for skip ghost pictures on the tv that occur at sunspot peaks c b interferance dead grass you name it btw the local operator should try and help you whether or not he or she is directly responsible it is part of being a good neighbor and that is how the fcc views it too bad they don t require the consumer equipment makers to take any precautions last you can usually tell ham radio vs cb ham operators are required to declare their call sign every so many minutes no more than 10 so if you hear this is wa1qt or some other call starting with a w or k and no more than 6 total characters you heard a ham cb ers probably won t sign i don t know that they re even required to and fire police have other private ids

2 | outbreaks of a chronic mono like entity were originally called ebs or some variant thereof because most of the people with this disease had elevated levels of antibodies to the ebv virus but not all of them did which prompted an official renaming of the disease to chronic fatigue syndrome this renaming took place in the annals of internal medicine jan 1988 i believe now it s also called chronic fatigue and immune dysfunction syndrome cfids since it seems clear that some sort of immune disregulation is causing the probs astonishly there are still docs who tell people with massively swollen glands recurrent fevers and nightsweats etc that there s nothing wrong with them this is not the same thing as saying that the syndrome may have a at least partly psychological cause the disagreement among people whose thoughts are worth considering centers on just what the cause is no one knows but theories include psychological stress some sort of virus a retrovirus say most maybe one of the newly discovered herpes viruses environmental toxins bacteria and yes candida genes and or some combo of these there s no outright cure at the moment but different docs try different things some of which seem to help massive amounts of info on the condition are available these days post your q to alt med cfs and you will be flooded w facts

2 | this is a lovely area for anecdotes but i am sure you are on to something as a physician i almost never get sick usually when something horrendous is going around i either don t get it at all or get a very mild case when i do get really sick it is always something unusual this was not the situation when i was in medical school particularly on pediatrics i never had younger siblings myself and when i went on the pediatric wards i suddenly found myself confronting all sorts of infectious challenges that my body was not ready for pediatrics for me was three solid months of illness and i had a temp of 104 when i took the final exam i think what happens is that during training and beyond we are constantly exposed to new things and we have the usual reactions to them so that later on when challenged with something it is more likely a re exposure for us so we deal with it well and get a mild illness i don t think it is that the immune system is hyped up in any way also don t forget that the hospital flora is very different from the home and we carry a lot of that around

2 | subject re eugenics probably within 50 years a new type of eugenics will be possible maybe even sooner we are now mapping the human genome we will then start to work on manipulation of that genome using genetic engineering we will be able to insert whatever genes we want no breeding no hybrids etc the ethical question is should we two past problems with eugenics have been 1 reducing the gene pool and 2 defining the status of the eugenized inserting genes would not seem to reduce the gene pool unless the inserted genes later became transmissible to progeny then they may be able to crowd out garbage genes this may in the future become possible even if it does awareness of the need to maintain the gene pool would hopefully mean provisions will be made for saving genes that may come in handy later evidently the genes for sickle cell disease in equatorial africa and for diabetes in the hopi promoted survival in some conditions we don t really know what the future may hold for our environment the reduced wilderness and disease survival capacity of our relatively inbred domesticated animals comes to mind vulcanism nuclear winter ice age meteor impact new microbiological threats famine global warming etc etc are all conceivable therefore having as many genes as possible available is a good strategy for species survival of course the status of genetically altered individuals would start out as no different than anyone else s but if we could make philosopher kings with great bodies and long lives would we or they want to give them elevated status we could the romans did it with their kings without the benefits of such eugenics the race eventually realized and dealt with the problems which that caused but for a while it was a problem orwell introduced us to the notion of what might happen to persons genetically altered for more menial tasks but there is nothing new under the sun we treated slaves the same way for millennia before 1984 i see no inherent problem with gene therapy which avoids at least these 2 problems humans have always had trouble having the virtue and wisdom to use any power that falls into their hands to good ends all the time that hasn t stopped the race as a whole yet many are the civilizations which have died from inability to adapt to environmental change however also many are the civilizations which have died from the abuse of their own power the ones which survived have hopefully learned a lesson from the fates of others and have survived by making better choices when their turns came not that i don t think that this gene altering power couldn t wipe us off the face of the earth or cause endless suffering nuclear power or global warming or whatever could and may still do that too the real issue is an issue of wisdom and virtue i personally don t think man has enough wisdom and virtue to pull this next challenge off any better than he did the for last few we as eugenists may make it an we may not if we don t i hope there are reservoirs of garbage people out in some backwater with otherwise long discarded garbage genes which will pull us through i believe that the real problem is and will probably always be the same man needs to accept input from the great spirit of god to overcome his lacks in the area of knowing how to use the power he has some men have and i believe all men may listen to and obey the still small voice of god in their hearts this is the way to begin to recieve the wisdom and virtue needed to escape the problems consequent to poor choices peoples have died out for many reasons the societies which failed to accept enough input from god to safely use the power they had developed have destroyed themselves and often others in the process it is self evident that the ones which survive today have either accepted enough input from the spirit to use their powers wisely enough to avoid or survive their own mistakes thus far or else haven t had enough power for long enough in summary i would say that the question of whether to use this new technology is really an ancient one and the answer in some ways hard in some ways easy is the same ancient answer it isn t the power it is the spirit sorry for the long post got carried away

2 | i recently learned about these devices that supposedly induce specific brain wave frequencies in their users simply by wearing them mind machines consist of led gogles head phones and a microprocessor that controls them they strobe the closed eye and send sound pulses in sync with the flashing leds i understand that these devices are experimental but they are available i ve heard claims that they can induce sleep and light trance states for relaxation essentially they are supposed to work without aid of drugs etc i would think that if they work as reported they would be incredibly useful the few sources i ve seen are biased they are selling the things and a friend who has tried them claims that every home should have one so do these mind machines aka light and sound machines work can they induce alpha theta and or delta waves in a person wearing them what research if any has been done on them could they be used in lieu of a tranquilizer or are they just another bit of quackery web homer

1 | from what i understand about radar dectectors all they are is a passive device much like the radio in your car they work as an antenna picking up that radar signals that the radar gun sends out therefore there would be no way of detecting a radar detector any more than there would be of detecting whether some one had a radio in their car
2 | have you ever met a chemist a food industry businessman you must personally know a lot of them for you to be able to be so certain that they are evil mosters whose only goal is to inflict as much pain and disease as possible into the general public gimme a break person who is very sensitive to msg and whose wife and kids are because it makes the food taste better why does it put salt in food same reason obviously of course not although i would think that a person like you would be a big fan of such recycling if that were the case on occasion that s probably the case but in general the idea is that msg improves the flavor of certain foods no no obviously as i recall these are natural by products of heating up certain foods they don t put it in there have a number of criteria in choosing how to process food they want to make it taste good look good sell for a good price etc the fact that they use it tells me that they think that it contributes to those goals they are interested in one of those goals is not making people sick such a goal woud quickly drive them out of business and for no benefit warning of what in california there is a law requiring that anything which contains a carcinogen be labeled that includes every gasline pump most foods and even money cleaning machines because nickel is a mild carcinogen the result is that now nobody pays any attention to any of the warnings why what if not 30 of people wanted to buy this ugly rotten not as tasty food i guess it will just be wasted huh how terribly efficient because it makes food look better i like food that looks good if vitamin companies want to do that it is fine but who are you to tell them how to make vitamins who are you to tell me whether i should buy flavored vitamins for my kids who can t swallow the conventional ones whole how do you define junk is putting salt in food bad what about pepper what about alcohol as a preservative what about sealing jars with wax what about vinegar you seem to think that chemicals are somehow different than food the fact is that all foods are 100 chemicals you are just expressing an irrational prejudice against food processing

1 | i have never worked with really small signals before and have a few questions about low level noise i have noticed that the waveform synthesizer that i am using analogic 2020 has some relatively large common mode noise on it i am using this synthesizer to null out another transient waveform and am amplifying the difference 200uv several hundred times the 2020 has about 1 3 mvp p of common mode noise and this tends to make my measurements hard to repeat the noise is not quite in sync with line frequency and on a spectrum analyzer the main component is about 64hz how can i get rid of the noise when i look at the spectrum using an hp 3582a audio range analyzer the noise goes away the minute i switch to isolation on the input i am guessing the anlayzer has a diff amp on the input since it will read accurately down to dc

3 | okay lets get the record straight on the livermore gas gun the project manager is dr john hunter and he works for the laser group at livermore what you may ask does gas guns have to do with lasers nothing really but the gun is physically located across the road from the free electron laser building and the fel building has a heavily shielded control room thick walls from which the gun firings are controlled so i suspect that the office he works for is an administrative convenience i visited hunter at the beginning of feb and we toured the gun at the time i was working on gas gun r d at boeing where i work but i am now doing other things helping to save the space station the gun uses a methane air mixture which is burned in a chamber about 200 ft long by 16 inch id i e it looks like a pipe the chamber holds a 1 ton piston which is propelled at several hundred m s down the chamber on the other side of the piston is hudrogen gas initially at room temperature andsome tens of atmospheres the piston compresses and heats the hydrogen ahead of it until a stainless steel burst diaphragm ruptures at around 50 000 psi the barrel of the gun is about 100 feet long and has a 4 inch bore it is mounted at right angles to the chamber i e they intersect this was done so that in the future the barrel could be raised and the gun fired into the air without having to move the larger and heavier chamber the projectile being used in testing is a 5 kg cylinder of lexan plastic 4 in in diameter and about 50 cm long all of the acceleration comes from the expansion of the hydrogen gas from 50 000 psi downwards until the projectile leaves the barrel the barrel is evacuated and the end is sealed with a sheet of plastic film a little thicker than saran wrap the plastic is blown off by the small amount of residual air trapped in the barrel ahead of the projectile the gun is fired into a bunker filled with sandbags and plastic water jugs in the early testing fragments of the plastic projectile were found at the higher speeds in later testing the projectile vaporizes the testing is into a bunker because the livermore test range is about 3 miles across and the projectile would go 100 200 km if fired for maximum range the intent is to move the whole gun to vandenberg afb after the testing is complete where they can fire into the pacific ocean and use the tracking radar at vafb to follow the projectiles the design goal of the gun is to throw a 5 kg projectile at 4 km s half of orbital speed so far they have reached 2 km s and the gun is currently down for repairs as on the last test they blew a seal and damaged some of the hardware i think it had to do with the methane air more detonating than burning but i haven t had a chance to talk to hunter directly on this there are people waiting to test scramjet components in this gun by firing then out of the gun into the air at mach 12 4 km s since the most you can get in wind tunnels is mach 8 this gun cost about 4 million to develop and is basically a proof of concept for a bigger gun capable of firing useful sized payloads into space this would require on the order of 100 kg projectiles which deliver on the order of 20 kg useful payload to orbit dani eder

2 | this reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot he used a strange technique i d never seen before he took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil the tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee table ash tray made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges in the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similar quantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of two teabags of earl grey tea and a few cloves on top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket type steamer with two chicken breasts in it the lid was put on and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for 10 or 12 minutes later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts what surprises and concerns me are 1 no wood chips where does the smoke flavor come from 2 about 5 or 10 years ago i remember hearing that carmel color obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavoring agent had been found to be carcinogenic i believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something if the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the u s yet it is still being used was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what 3 about 5 or 10 years ago i remember earl grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit does anyone know whatever happened with that story if it were carcinogenic earl grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do so wrt natural wood smoke i ve smoking a duck right now as it happens i ve noticed that a heavily smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips my theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low molecular weight stuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar the long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low molecular weight stuff just leaving the flavor behind does anyone know if my theory is correct i also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic for that reason and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess i only grill non drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals i do stuff like this duck by indirect heat i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end the fat drops directly on the floor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals and yet another reason i ve heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon contains nitrosamines which are carcinogenic i m pretty sure this claim actually has some standing don t know about the others

hiv positive patients as soon as possible after seroconversion resulting from recent findings that show hiv is active in the body in large numbers much earlier than was previously believed anthony fauci director of the u s national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid said we must address the question of how to treat people as early as we possibly can with drugs that are safe enough to give people for years and that will get around microbial resistance he said any delay would signify questions over safety and resistance rather than a lack of funds fauci who co authored one of the two papers published last week in nature rejects the argument by one of his co authors cecil fox that the new discovery indicates that 1 billion spent on vaccine trials has been a waste of time and money because the trials were started too long after the patients were infected and were ended too quickly john tew of the medical college of virginia in richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument for early treatment of hiv infected patients aids activists welcomed the new information but said the scientific community has been slow to understand the significance of infection of the lymph tissue we ve known about this for five years but we re glad it is now in the public domain said jesse dobson of the california based project inform but peter duesberg who

aids virus from doctors found to be minimal washington post 04 14 93 p a9 the risk of hiv being transmitted from infected health care professionals to patients is minimal according to new research published in today s journal of the american medical association jama this finding supports previous conclusions by health experts that the chance of contracting hiv from a health care worker is remote three studies in the jama demonstrate that thousands of patients were treated by two hiv positive surgeons and dentists without becoming infected with the virus the studies were conducted by separate research teams in new hampshire maryland and florida each study started with an hiv positive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to participate the new hampshire study found that none of the 1 174 patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an hiv positive orthopedic surgeon contracted hiv in maryland 413 of 1 131 patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist

to more than 10 billion for the nih as a whole in addition the money for available research grants is even smaller about 500 000 to 600 000 total will be available this year for 10 or 20 grants kaiya montaocean of the center for natural and traditional medicine in washington d c says the oam is afraid to become involved in aids they have to look successful and there is no easy answer in aids she said there is also a common perception that the oam will focus on fields the nih establishment will find non threatening such as relaxation techniques and acupuncture when the oam called for an advisory committee conference of about 120 people last year the aids community was largely missing from the meeting in addition activists general lack of contact with the office has added suspicion

health care agency santa ana calif and the emory university school of public health in atlanta ga respectively dr berkley s editorial on why american doctors should care about the aids epidemic beyond the united states details several reasons for the concerted interest that all countries share in combating aids it should be noted that while aids leads in hastening global health interdependence it is not the only illness doing so diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that aids will have on many developing countries and the increased need for international assistance that will result berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness toward the aids epidemic in its first decade but now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approach to international health and development in general and hiv aids in particular vice president al gore proposes in his book earth in the balance a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development with programs to promote literacy improve child survival and disseminate contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing world if enacted this change in policy

medical association 04 07 93 vol 269 no 13 p 1636 berkley seth every nation should tackle hiv as early and aggressively as possible before the disease reaches an endemic state even at a cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses writes seth berkley of the rockefeller foundation in new york n y in reply to a letter by drs gellert and nordenberg although it is true that diseases other than aids such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attention than they are getting berkley disagrees with the contention that aids is receiving too much attention hiv differs from other diseases in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread for most endemic diseases the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year of about the same level of needless disease and death but with aids and its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in disease burden but financially is much greater interventions in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like hiv are highly cost effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission berkley says he agrees with gellert and nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of aids and about the need for political leadership but he concludes that not only is assertive political leadership needed in the united states for the aids epidemic but even more so in developing countries with high rates of hiv infection and where complacency about the epidemic has been the rule hicnet medical newsletter page 46 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 aids hiv articles first hiv vaccine trial begins in hiv infected children h h s n e

children recruited from at least 12 sites nationwide volunteers must be hiv infected but have no symptoms of hiv disease hhs secretary donna e shalala said this initial study can be seen as a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of hiv infected children who now face the certainty they will develop aids anthony s fauci m d director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and of the nih office of aids research said the trial is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with hiv who are not yet sick if these vaccines prove to be safe more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in phase ii trials the centers for disease control and prevention estimates 10 000 children in the united states have hiv by the end of the decade the world health organization projects 10 million children will be infected worldwide the study will enroll children ages 1 month to 12 years old niaid which funds the aids clinical trials group network anticipates conducting the trial at nine actg sites around the country and three sites participating in the actg but funded by the national institute of child health and human development preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing hiv specific immune responses and hicnet medical newsletter page 47 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 stimulate new ones it will be several years however before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease the results from the pediatric trial known as actg 218 will be examined closely for other reasons as well this trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate hiv vaccines said daniel hoth m d director of niaid s division of aids we need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent hiv infection in children in the united states most hiv infected children live in poor inner city areas and more than 80 percent are minorities mainly black or hispanic nearly all hiv infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or at birth an infected mother in the united states has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby as growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to hiv through injection drug use or infected sexual partners researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children hiv disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults the most recent information suggests that 50 percent of infants born with hiv develop a serious aids related infection by 3 to 6 years of age these infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures pneumonia diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays at least half of the children in the trial will be 2 years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants all volunteers must have well documented hiv infection but no symptoms of hiv disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen they cannot have received any anti retroviral or immune regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study study chair john s lambert m d of the university of rochester medical school and co chair samuel katz m d of duke university school of medicine will coordinate the trial assisted by james mcnamara m d medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of niaid s division of aids we will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers for example than another said dr mcnamara we ll also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects he emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three hicnet medical newsletter page 48 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 products the trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant hiv proteins these so called subunit vaccines each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of the virus have so far proved well tolerated in ongoing trials in hiv infected adults one vaccine made by microgenesys inc of meriden conn contains gp160 a protein that gives rise to hiv s surface proteins plus alum adjuvant adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine presently alum is the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the food and drug administration both of the other vaccines one made by genentech inc of south san francisco and the other by biocine a joint venture of chiron and ciba geigy in emeryville calif contain the major hiv surface protein gp120 plus adjuvant the genentech vaccine contains alum while the biocine vaccine contains mf59 an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in other phase i vaccine trials in adults a low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in 15 children twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the experimental vaccine and three children will be given adjuvant alone considered the placebo neither the health care workers nor the children will be told what they receive if the low dose is

immunodeficiency virus can cause disease independently of its ability to suppress the immune system say scientists at the national institues of health they report that hiv itself not an opportunistic infection caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for hiv although the hiv genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animals immunity the researchers found this led them to conclude that the hiv itself caused the skin disease our findings support a growing body of evidence that hiv can cause disease without affecting the immune system said lead author dr jeffrey kopp of the national institute of dental research nidr dr kopp and his colleagues described their study in the march issue of aids research and human retroviruses developing animal models of hiv infection has been difficult since most animals including mice cannot be infected by the virus to bypass this problem scientists have developed hiv transgenic mice which carry genes for hiv as well as their own genetic material nidr scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting hiv genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice the resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of hiv genetic material in l988 those mice however became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth in the present study the scientists used an incomplete copy of hiv which allowed the animals to live longer some of the transgenic animals developed scaling wart like tumors on their necks and backs other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in humans no skin lesions developed in their normal non transgenic littermates studies of tissue taken from the wart like skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a protein producing molecule made by the hiv genetic material hicnet medical newsletter page 50 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 evidence of hiv protein production proved that the viral genes were turned on or active said dr kopp the scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in the mice no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections the fact that hiv genes were active but the animals immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions dr kopp said further proof of hiv gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light the light increased hiv genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin papilloma formation in response to increased hiv genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition the scientists said no lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the uv light the transgenic mice used in this study were developed at nidr by dr

nationwide clinical consultation telephone service for doctors and other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with hiv infection or aids the toll free national hiv telephone consulting service is staffed by a physician a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist it provides information on drugs clinical trials and the latest treatment methods the service is funded by the health resources and services administration and operates out of san francisco general hospital secretary shalala said one goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care a second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with hiv or aids which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks currently many providers refer patients with hiv or aids to specialists or other providers who have more experience secretary shalala said this clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who treat people with hiv or aids in communities and clinical sites where hiv expertise is not readily available the telephone number for health care professionals is 1 800 933 3413 and it is accessible from 10 30 a m to 8 p m est 7 30 a m to 5 p m pst monday through friday during these times consultants will try to answer questions immediately or within an hour at other times physicians and health care providers can leave an electronic message and questions will be answered as quickly as possible health care professionals may call the service to ask any question related to providing hiv care including the latest hiv aids drug treatment information clinical trials information subspecialty case referral literature searches and other information the service is designed for health care professionals rather than patients families or others who have alternate sources of information or materials when a health care professional calls the new service the call is taken by either a clinical pharmacist primary care physician or family nurse practitioner all staff members have extensive experience in outpatient and inpatient primary care for people with hiv related diseases the consultant asks for patient specific information including cd4 cell count current medications sex age and the patient s hiv history this national service has grown out of a 16 month local effort that hicnet medical newsletter page 52 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 responded to nearly 1 000 calls from health care providers in northern

2 | hi janet sounds exactly like mine same circumstance same onset symptoms same cafergot uselessness same duration in fact of all the people i know who have migraines none have been so similar there is such a wide variation between people with respect to what causes their headaches that i generally don t bother sharing what i ve learned about mine but since ours seem to be alike here are my observations i don t think it s heat per se i ve had more in winter than summer dehydration could conceivably figure though try tanking up before playing rather than after being in shape doesn t seem to help me much either i ve identified four factors that do make a difference listed in descending order of importance 1 heavy exercise 2 sleep deprivation 3 fasting e g skipped breakfast 4 physical trauma e g head bonk heavy exercise has preceded all of my post adolescent migraines but i don t get migraines after every heavy exercise session one or more of the other factors must be present usually 2 since i discovered this i ve been nearly migraine free relapsing only once every two or three years when i get cocky it s been so long maybe i just don t get them anymore and stop being careful hope this is helpful
2 | i do not know a lot about this except from seeing one patient with kartagener s syndrome which is a form of immotile cilia syndrome in which there is situs inversus bronchiectasis and chronic infections situs inversus means that organs are on the wrong side of the body and can be complete or partial it is interesting medically because the normal location of organs is caused in part by the normal rotation associated with ciliary motion so that in absence of this laterality can be random people with situs inversus are quite popular at medical schools because of their rarity and the fact that most doctors get a bit upset when they can t find the patient s heart sounds because they re on the wrong side according to harrison s immotile cilia syndrom is an autosomal recessive which should imply that on average one child in four in a family would be affected but there may be much more current information on this and as usual in medicine we may be talking about more than one conditiion i would suggest that you ask your pediatrician about contacting a medical geneticics specialist of which there is probably one at ncsu
3 | gee i feel so ignorant now research then post
3 | i love the idea of an inflatable 1 mile long sign it will be a really neat thing to see it explode when a bolt or even better a westford needle comes crashing into it at 10 clicks a sec pageos and two echo balloons were inflated with a substance which expanded in vacuum once inflated the substance was no longer needed since there is nothing to cause the balloon to collapse this inflatable structure could suffer multiple holes with no disastrous deflation
1 | bubblejets often splatter a little bit whereas laserjets given half way decent toner like hp s microfine stuff don t both produce very good output but you don t have to look too closely at the two to tell that laserjet output is definitely superior on the other hand laserjets which haven t been maintained properly and use the cheapest toner the owner could find often produce awful output much worse than a bubblejet one other thing there are bubblejets and then there are bubblejets there are a few bubblejets out there that produce rather mediocre output such as hp s dinky little bubblejet whereas most produce really good looking output such as hp s deskjets ibm and canon both produce some of the really good style bubblejets joel kolstad

1 | i ve recently picked up some til311 display chips but i can t find any information on them it seems they are no longer made by ti and i don t have an old enough data book it appears to have a dot matrix led display capable of showing one hex digit it is in a 14 pin dip package but pins 6 9 and 11 are not present if you have any information on this part pinout power requirments functions please send me e mail thank you
3 | no instead you have stupid things like 3600 and 86400 and 31556925 9747 and 299792 458 and 9 80665 and how many cc s in a ml anyway the metric system has its problems just not as many of them
3 | great speculation i remember being proud on behalf of all the free world you think that way when you are seven years old that we had got there first now i m almost sorry that it worked out that way i guess the soviets would have taken the victory seriously too and would almost certainly not have fallen victim to the complacency that overtook the us program perhaps stretching to match us efforts would have destabilized them sooner than it did in fact and in the tradition of marvel comics what if this destabilization in the brezhnev era might have triggered the third world war hmm maybe it was a giant leap after all
3 | well i guess i m left wondering just who all the light fascists think they are yes i understand the issues i don t even particularly care for the idea but am i the only one that finds the sort of overreaction above just a little questionable you must find things like the moon really obnoxious in their pollution a few questions for those frothing at the mouth to ask themselves 1 how long is this thing supposed to stay up sounds like it would have a huge drag area not a lot of mass and be in a fairly low orbit 2 just what orbital parameters are we talking about here what real impact are we talking about really how many optical astronomers are really going to be impacted 3 which is more important adding a few extra days of seeing for very few optical astronomers or getting the data the sensors are supposed to return along with the data for large inflatables and the potential there for an inflatable space station the choice would seem to be one or the other since the advertising is being used to help fund this thing 4 if your answer to 3 above was the astronomers then feel free to come up with some other way to fund the to my mind more important research data that would be gained by this without spending any more of my money to do it in other words put up or shut up probably so i m just not sure we agree about who the stupid are yeah me too insisting on perfect safety is for people who don t have the balls to live in the real world mary shafer nasa ames dryden
3 | speech by pete worden delivered before the u s space foundation conference colorado springs colorado april 15 1993 what a delightful opportunity to cause some trouble for providing me this forum i would sincerely like to thank the u s space foundation my topic today is the single stage rocket technology rocket or ssrt by i intend to speak of more how to lower the cost and make rapid progress ssrt is to my mind and i hope to convince you the erupting a new rallying cry for our generation in space faster cheaper and better faster cheaper better and ssrt represent the passing of a torch from one technical generation to another it is a new thing to be sure but it is also a relearning of old things from past masters when we rolled out the ssrt baby two weeks ago so called experts told us it violates the laws of physics it made no sense for example dr eberhart rachtin former president of the aerospace corp said of ssrt in the l a times that it defies the best principles of launching payloads into space well dr rachtin you ve made us mad what are these principles that ssrt defies well i ll tell you it violates the principle that you need a giant program office to build space hardware it violates the fact that it takes 20 years to build something new and it violates the truism that you cant do anything significant for less than many billions of dollars it took some of the last generation s experts to teach us some new old lessons werhner von braun s first rocket was not a saturn v general schriever s icbm s didn t take ten years to demonstrate and the x 1 airplane didn t cost 1 billion it took one of the great engineers of the 1950 s to remind us of these truths max hunter max to remind you was a senior engineer in the thor irbm program and old faster better cheaper success story max has been persistent in a vision of a single stage reusable space launch system since the 1960 s because he knew it had to be done in affordable steps build a little test a little next he persuaded us to do a technology demonstration we didn t solicit a bunch of requirements they d just change every few years anyway not included in the speech the als nls has such ephemeral requirements that it would better known as shape shifter than space lifter we didn t spend a lot money this x rocket only cost 60 million when s the last time we even built a new airplane for that and it didn t take a lot of time to build mcdonnell douglas completed it in 18 months finally the government program office consisted of one very over worked air force major motivated in part by the threat that he d get to ride on it in a strapped on lawn chair if it ran over cost or schedule as i described what ssrt is and isn t keep in mind its only a first step there are several more steps and steps that can easily fail before the u s can field an ssto but each step should follow the same principles a small management team a few years technology demonstration and a modest budget let me show a few details on ssrt and how it might evolve see charts i m embarrassed when my generation is compared with the last generation the giants of the last great space era the 1950 s and 1960 s they went to the moon we built a telescope that can t see straight they soft landed on mars the least we could do is soft land on earth but we do have an answer we can follow their build a little test a little philosophy to produce a truly affordable and routine access to space i know there are nay sayers among you those who say ssrt is a stunt it needs more thermal protection the engines are wrong it would be better to land horizontally etc etc i say to you we ll see you at white sands in june you bring your view graphs and i ll bring my rocketship if we do what we say we can do then you let us do the next step not included in the speech if we fail you still have your program offices staff summary sheets requirement analyses and decade long programs
3 | yes the phobos mission did return some useful data including images of phobos itself the best i ve seen had a surface resolution of about 40 meters by the way the new book entitled mars kieffer et al 1992 university of arizona press has a great chapter on spacecraft exploration of the planet the chapter is co authored by v i moroz of the space research institute in moscow and includes details never before published in the west don t know of any ftp sites with images though

1 | i m looking for brief information on new applications of electronics or new electronics in applications if you know of any interesting new stuff i would be intrested in hearing about it
2 | are you arguing that the lyme lab test is accurate the books that i ve read say that in general the tests have a 50 50 chance of being correct the tests result in a large number of both false positives and false negatives i am in the latter case we could get those same odds by rolling the dice
1 | does anyone out there know of any ftp sites which deal with electronics projects plans etc any response appreciated jb
2 | avoiding mistakes is certainly highly desirable however it is also widely acknowledged that perfectionism is inimicable to creativity and in ordinary life perfectionism carried beyond a certain point is indicative of a psychological disorder in the extreme case a perfectionist becomes so paralyzed by all the possible mistakes he might make that he is unable to even leave the house in science we want to discover as much truth about the world as possible and we also want to have as much certainty as possible about these discoveries usually there is some trade off between these two desiderata the search for scope and the search for certainty if 18th century mathematicians had demanded total rigor from newton and leibniz then there would probably be no calculus today because neither of the two could explain calculus in a way that really made sense since they lacked the concept of a limit and in fact because of the lack of a rigorous foundation they made a number of errors in their use of calculus it was only a hundred years later that weistrass was able to give a solid grounding for the ideas of newton and leibniz nonetheless what newton and leibniz did was undoubtedly science and mathematics gained a great deal more from the application of their important ideas than it lost through the mistakes they made these are not the rules according to many who post to sci med and sci psychology according to these posters if it s not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it s not science taken to the extreme i believe that the attitude that empirical studies are everything and ideas are nothing results in a complete stultification of science for one thing an insistence on an elaborate and expensive methodology results in a sort of scientific trade unionism where those outside the establishment and lacking institutional or corporate support have no chance to obtain a hearing i don t in the least believe that this is the intention of the arbiters of scientific methodology nonetheless it is one of the results and although institutional science has certainly produced many wonderful results i think it is a foolish arrogance for scientists to believe that no one outside the establishment and using less than perfect empirical methodology will ever come with anything worthwhile furthermore the big bucks approach to science promotes what i think is one of the most significant errors in science choosing to investigate questions because they can be readily handled by the currently fashionable methodology or because one can readily get institutional or corporate sponsorship for them instead of directing attention to those questions which seem to have fundamental significance for instance certain questions cannot be easily investigated with statistical methods because the relevant factors are not quantitative one could argue that this is the case for almost all questions in many areas of psychology in my opinion a perusal of many of the papers resulting from the attempt by psychologists to force these questions into a statistical framework gives the lie to russell turpin s assertion that current scientific methods avoid all known errors i think that asking the wrong question is probably the most fundamental error in science ignoring potentially valuable ideas is one of the others and i think that scientific journals are full of all too many studies done with impeccable empirical methods but which are worthless because the wrong question was asked in the first place in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

3 | the orion concept as actually proposed as opposed to the way it has been somewhat misrepresented in some fiction included wrapping a thick layer of reaction mass probably plastic of some sort around each bomb the bomb vaporizes the reaction mass and it s that which transfers momentum to the pusher plate
3 | you re assuming that the low cost delivery system has to be a separate project but why if you are spending hundreds of millions of dollars in hopes of winning a billion dollar prize it is cheaper to develop your own launch system charging its entire development cost against your contest entry than to try to do it with existing launchers no other demand is necessary you re assuming that it s going to take a decade to build a new launch system but why the saturn v took less than six years depending on exactly when you date its start pegasus took about three from project start to first flight before sdio chickened out on orbital development the target date for an orbital dc y flight was 1996 if you really want speed consider that the first prototypes of the thor missile still in service as the core of the delta launcher shipped to the usaf less than 18 months after the development go ahead
2 | food poisoning is only one of the many possible causes yes even other people share the food boy you computer people only know 1s and 0s but not much about logic no i did not said msg was not the culprit what i argued was that that there was enough reasonable doubt to convict msg if you want to convict msg show me the evidence not quilty by suspicion nobody is forcing you to change what you believe but i certainly don t want to see somebody preach to ban pepper because that makes him her sneeze that is exactly what some anti msg activitiests are doing look people with a last chen don t necessarily own a chinese restaurant i am not interested if you enjoy chinese food or not exploiting my last name to discredit me on the issue is hitting below the belt what i am interested in is the truth let me give you an excert from a recent fda hearing there is no evidence orally consumed glutamate has any effect on the brain said dr richard wurtman of massachusetts institute of technology the anecdotal experiences of individuals is superstition not science he said i don t think glutamate has made them sick and dr robert kenney of george washington university conducted an double blind test in 1980 showing that the 35 people who reacted to msg also had similar reaction when they thought they had msg but actually not although there are many contradicting personal stories told in this group some of them might have been due to other causes but because the anti msg emotion runs so high that some blame it for anything and everything my purpose is to present a balance view on the issue although i am probably 20 1 outnumbered
1 | except for their size the cooling towers on nuclear power plants are vertually identical in construction and operation to cooling towers designed and built in the 1890 s a hundred years ago for coal fired power plants used for lighting and early electric railways basicly the cylindrical tower supports a rapid air draft when its air is heated by hot water and or steam circulating thru a network of pipes that fill about the lower 1 3 of the tower to assist cooling and the draft water misters are added that spray cold water over the hot pipes the cold water evaporates removing the heat faster than just air flow from the draft would and the resulting water vapor is rapidly carried away by the draft this produces the clouds frequently seen rising out of these towers that slight pinch maybe 2 3 of the way up the tower is there because it produces a very significant increase in the strength and rate of the air draft produced compared to a straight cylinder shape the towers are used to recondense the steam in the sealed steam system of the power plant so that it can be recirculated back to the boiler and used again the wider the temperature difference across the turbines used in the power plant the more effecient they are and by recondensing the steam in the cooling towers before sending it back to the boilers you maintain a very wide temperature difference sometimes as high as 1000 degrees or more from first stage hot turbine to final stage cold turbine r tim coslet
1 | and the measure of current amp is actually named after both the amp company and the amphenol company both companies revolutionized electronics by simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets were affected by the amount of current running through the wires sorry the unit for current is the ampere which is the name of a french man named ampere who studied electrical current the term amp is just an abbreviation of it the company amp came after the ampere unit was already in use the ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers thus our use of the ohms i don t know about this one but it doesn t sound right are you two joking is the entire internet flaming you two ahh now i remember that ohmite company was the first introducing the pink colored resistor only for electronics working females manuel arrevola velasco true e mail manolo taf fundesco es dod 1033 yes i have taken a bit of flame on this one i must ve been half asleep when i posted a response to joseph greggo
1 | i have a thermal fuse from a apple laserwriter ii power supply made by cannon that i need to replace the fuse is not the standard tubular thermal fuse like those found in hair driers etc but is a rectangular plastic package much like a transistor or diode it is about 0 2 x0 2 x0 1 with both leads coming out of one of the 0 1 x0 1 sides i have been told that it was made by miti a asian company but i can find no information as to a supplier this fuse is rated at 1a 130c does anyone have a source for this fuse i only need 5 or so which means that the manufacturer wouldn t even want to talk to me let alone deal with me please advise via e mail thanks pat
1 | is there a fast n dirty way to kill the line spiking that occurs when an inductive load is turned on sometime other than at zero crossing of the ac cycle a capacitor kludged in somehow etc i ve got a microcontroller that is running a bunch of valves and pumps in a big instrument washer and almost everything is being switched with zero crossing solid state relays so that stuff stays quiet ac wise but there s one steam valve that gets turned on by a mechanical relay in the water tank fill thermostat system and it s not under control of my ssrs and it does sometimes generate radiate a spike that resets one of my peripheral chips my software times out and tries again but i d love to just tack in a magic spike killing fix that would avoid having to do some major rewiring redesign a varistor would help but might not be sufficient ideas

2 | someone wrote in expressing concern about getting aids from acupuncture needles unless your friend is sharing fluids with their acupuncturist who themselves has aids it is unlikely not impossible they will get aids from acupuncture needles generally even if accidently inoculated the normal immune response should be enough to effectively handle the minimal contaminant involved with acupuncture needle insertion most acupuncturists use disposable needles use once and throw away they do this because you are not the only one concerned about transmission of diseases via this route so it s good business to advertise disposable needlesused here these needles tend to be of a lower quality however being poorly manufactured and too sharp in my opinion they tend to snag bloodvessels on insertion compared to higher quality needles if i choose to use acupuncture for a given complaint that patient will get their own set of new needles which are sterilized between treatments the risk here for hepatitis hiv etc transmission is that i could mistakenly use an infected persons needles accidently on the wrong patient but clear labelling and paying attention all but eliminates this risk better quality needles tend to slide past vessels and nerves avoiding unpleasant painful snags and hematomas so i use them acupuncture needles come in many lengths and thicknesses but they are all solid when compared to their injection style cousins in china herbal solutionsand western pharmaceuticals are occasionally injected into meridian points purported to have tcm physiologic effects and so require the same hollow needles used for injecting fluid medicine this means thinkingtiny that a samll amount of tissue the diameter of the needle bore will be injected into the body as it would be in a typical shot when the skin is puntured on the other hand when the solid acupuncture needle is inserted the skin tends to squeeze the needle from the tip to the level of insertion such that any cooties that haven t been schmeared away with alcohol before insertion tend to remain on the surface of the skin minimizing invasion from the exterior of course in tcm the body s exterior is protected by the wei protective qi so infection is unlikely or in other words there is a normal inflammatory and immune response that accompanies tissue damage incurred at the puncture site while i m fairly certain your friend will not have a transferable disease transmitted to them via acupuncture needle insertion i would like to know for what complaint they have consulted the acupuncturist not to know if it would be harmful but to know if it would be helpful
2 | i had allergy shots for about four years starting as a sophomore in high school before that i used to get bloody noses nighttime asthma attacks and eyes so itchy i couldn t get to sleep after about 6 months on the shots most of those symptoms were gone and they haven t come back i stopped getting the shots due more to laziness than planning in college my allergies got a little worse after that but are still nowhere near as bad as they used to be so yes the shots do work

2 | no i was one of the lucky ones very little acne as a teenager i didn t have any luck with clearasil even though my skin gets oily it really only gets miserable pimples when it s dry frequent lukewarm water rinses on the face might help getting the scalp thing under control might help that could be as simple as submerging under the bathwater till it s softened and washing it out taking a one a day vitamin mineral might help i ve heard iodine causes trouble and that it is used in fast food restaurants to sterilize equipment which might be where the belief that greasy foods cause acne came from i notice grease on my face not immediately removed will cause acne even from eating meat keeping hair rinse mousse dip and spray off the face will help warm water bath soaks or cloths on the face to soften the oil in the pores will help prevent blackheads body oil is hydrophilic loves water and it softens and washes off when it has a chance that s why hair goes limp with oilyness becoming convinced that the best thing to do with a whitehead is leave it alone will save him days of pimple misery any prying of black or whiteheads can cause infections the red spots of pimples usually a whitehead will break naturally in a day and there won t be an infection afterwards tell him that it s normal to have some pimples but the cosmetic industry makes it s money off of selling people on the idea that they are an incredible defect to be hidden at any cost even that of causing more pimples
3 | i am puzzled by the term concept drag free may already have been flown it was the idea behind putting up a spacecraft that would more accurately respond to motions from the earth s gravity field and ignore drag it was proposed many years ago and involved a ball floating between sensors whose job it was to signal to little adjustment jets to keep the ball away from them the ball itself would then be in a drag free condition and respond only to gravity anisotropies whereas the spacecraft itself would be continuously adjusting its position to compensate for drag
1 | the atari 2600 used a 6502 cpu just like their entire 8 bit line 400 800 1200 1400 1440 130xe 65xe computers as well as the 5200 game machine the 2600 had some extra asic chips that were basically modified graphics chips and pia s for the joysticks later model 2600 might have incorporated many of the chips into one asci as the weight of the machines and part count decreased a lot over the years additionally i think the 2600 used 2k 4k and up to 8k of rom for their games i have no idea how much ram it had to work with but i would hazard a guess of 2 or 4k ram think comes from a lot of hacking with the 800 and 130xe computers and occasionally hacking with the 2600 fixing it for monitor composite video use and audio hookups also i tryed to make a cartridge less system that stored the rom into a ram cartridge that could be loaded up at some prior time a way to backup cartridges i ve heard of a setup like this where games could be bought cheaply on fsk recorded tapes then you would load them into a special ram cartidge and play them anyways if you re interested in looking for 2600 equipment we ve got two 2600 machines around one composite a v modified and lotsa cartridges willing to sell for reasonable offer shipping and handling don t play it anymore since going to computers nintendo interested in that too

2 | the biggest reason why the cost of medical care is so extremely high and increasing is that natural methods of treatment and even diagnosis are still being systematically ignored and suppressed by the money grubbing and power mongering medical establishment some examples of very low cost natural anti cancer remedies are listed in the following article natural anti cancer remedies a 3rd opinion some of these remedies also work against aids disclaimer this list was compiled from unorthodox sources that have shown themselves to be reliable the compiler of this list is not a doctor of any kind but is exercising his first amendment constitutional right of free speech on the subjects of his choice most of these remedies can be found in any grocery store most of the rest of them can be found in any health food store what is important is how they are used and what else is excluded during their use 1 the 7 day fast 1st day eat as much fresh fruit as you want one kind at a time preferably grapes 2nd day eat all the vegetables you want at least half raw including garlic also whole kernel corn to help scrape clean the intestinal linings 3rd day drink all the fresh fruit and vegetable juice you want preferably start with 16 to 32 ounces of prune juice with pulp followed by a gallon of pure not from concentrate apple juice then grape juice stay close to your home bathroom 4th day eat all the un salted nuts no peanuts and dried fruit you want preferably raisins and almonds almonds contain laetrile 5th day one gallon of lemonade squeeze the juice from two lemons into a gallon of water preferably distilled and add 2 to 4 tablespoons of locally made honey no sugar drink one glass per hour everyone including healthy people should do this one day every week preceded by a large glass of prune juice with pulp 6th day same as 5th day 7th day same as 6th day all 7 days eat only the foods listed above for each day along with your usual vitamin and mineral supplements plus as much distilled water as you want 2 the grape diet eat 2 to 3 ounces of fresh grapes every 2 hours 8 am to 8 pm every day for six days eat nothing else during the six days but drink as much distilled water as you want 3 apple cider vinegar mix a teaspoon of pure apple cider vinegar not apple cider flavored vinegar regular vinegar is harmful in a glass of water preferably distilled and drink all of it do this 3 or 4 times per day for 3 weeks then stop for a week repeat if desired do this along with a normal healthy diet of natural foods this remedy is especially effective against those types of cancer that resemble a fungus as well as against other kinds of fungus infections 4 the sea salt soda bath please keep an open mind fill a bathtub with moderately warm water so the level comes up almost to the overflow drain when you get in immerse yourself in it for a minute and then completely dissolve in the bath water 1 pound of sun evaporated sea salt regular salt won t work and 1 pound of fresh baking soda soak in this bath for 10 to 20 minutes while exercising your fingers toes and limbs turning sideways and onto your stomach dunking your head sitting up and laying back down chomping your teeth together etc among other things the sea salt soda bath neutralizes the accumulated effects of x rays etc as described in the book born to be magnetic vol 2 by frances nixon 1973 precautions only the one person using each bath should prepare it and drain it for at least 30 minutes after taking the bath stay away from and even out of sight of other people your greatly expanded aura energy field during that time could disrupt other people s fields two hours after the bath eat at least 8 ounces of yogurt containing active yogurt cultures the bath may kill friendly bacteria also better yet take a 2 billion bacteria acidophilus capsule which is also an excellent daily remedy against the effects of a i d s because it kills all kinds of harmful bacteria in the digestive tract taking a big load off the remaining immune system because this external bath can kill in ternal bacteria it may also be a cure for lyme disease do not take this bath within a few hundred miles of a thunder storm within 3 days of a full moon nor during major or minor periods as listed in the solunar tables published bimonthly in field stream magazine because of the measurable disruptive ambient environmental energy fields present at those times do not take this bath more than four times per year 5 miscellaneous natural anti cancer remedies for skin cancer apply stabilized aloe vera jel to the affected skin twice daily and take 2 to 4 tablespoons per day of stabilized aloe vera juice internally for about 2 months d m s o dimethyl sulfoxide causes cancer cells to perform normal cell functions almonds un blanched un roasted contain laetrile to help prevent cancer eat several almonds every day to help cure cancer eat several ounces of almonds per day never take large concentrated doses of laetrile orally it will kill you take it intravenously only cancer cells contain a certain enzyme which converts laetrile into cyanide which then kills the cell this enzyme is also present in the digestive system anti oxidants are free radical scavengers and include vitamin e selenium 200 mcg per day is safe for most people chromium up to 100 mcg per day vitamin a 25 000 iu per day is safe for most people superoxide dismutase up to 4 000 000 units per day vitamin c up to 3000 mg per day and bht butylated hydroxy toluene 1 to 4 capsules of bht every night at bedtime will also make one immune against herpes both types suppress herpes symptoms if one already has herpes prevent spreading herpes to other people but will not cure herpes bht might also do these things against a i d s which is really a form of cancer similar to leukemia see the book life extension by durk pearson and sandy shaw hydrogen peroxide dilute twelve 12 drops of 3 hydrogen peroxide in a glass of pure water preferably distilled and drink it do this once or twice per day hours before or after eating or drinking anything else apply 3 hydrogen peroxide directly to skin cancers several times per day use hydrogen peroxide only if you are taking a good daily dose of some of the various anti oxidants described above vitamin mineral supplements are more effective and much less expensive when combined together in mega doses into single tablets made from natural sources cancer cells can not live in a strong 100 000 maxwell north magnetic field especially if it is pulsating on and off a strong south magnetic field is an aphrodisiac in my opinion all types of ionizing radiation treatments for cancer should be replaced with daily 30 minute doses of pulsating 100 000 maxwell north magnetic fields properly made and operated radionics psionics machines can both diagnose and cure all forms of cancer as well as most other medical problems some radionics psionics machines can even take cross sectional x ray like photos of cancer tumors etc with out x rays interferon tablets taheebo tea lapacho homeopathy can cure cancer and many other medical problems even drug addiction 50 mg per day of chelated zinc can help prevent or cure prostate trouble this list is not exhaustive the above natural remedies can cure both diagnosed and un diagnosed cancers as well as prevent them and also prevent and cure many other medical problems including heart diseases they are not too simple and inexpensive to work effectively besides acting on a person biologically and chemically these remedies especially the 7 day fast and the grape diet send a strong message to one s subconscious mind programming it to cure the cancer in my opinion if a person finds out that s he has cancer then s he should promptly try at least the first 4 remedies described above in sequence starting with the 7 day fast before resorting to the un natural and expensive mutilations and agonies poison burn and

copy for the most up to date information on upcoming missions call 407 867 info 867 4636 at kennedy space center official nasa shuttle status reports are posted to sci space news frequently why does the shuttle roll just after liftoff the following answer and translation are provided by ken jenks kjenks gothamcity jsc nasa gov the ascent guidance and flight control training manual asc g c 2102 during the vertical rise phase the launch pad attitude is commanded until an i loaded v rel sufficient to assure launch tower clearance is achieved then the tilt maneuver roll program orients the vehicle to a heads down attitude required to generate a negative q alpha which in turn alleviates structural loading other advantages with this attitude are performance gain decreased abort maneuver complexity improved s band look angles and crew view of the horizon the tilt maneuver is also required to start gaining downrange velocity to achieve the main engine cutoff meco target in second stage this really is a good answer but it s couched in nasa jargon i ll try to interpret 1 we wait until the shuttle clears the tower before rolling 2 then we roll the shuttle around so that the angle of attack between the wind caused by passage through the atmosphere the relative wind and the chord of the wings the imaginary line between the leading edge and the trailing edge is a slightly negative angle a negative q alpha this causes a little bit of downward force toward the belly of the orbiter or the z direction and this force alleviates structural loading we have to be careful about those wings they re about the most delicate part of the vehicle 3 the new attitude after the roll also allows us to carry more mass to orbit or to achieve a higher orbit with the same mass or to change the orbit to a higher or lower inclination than would be the case if we didn t roll performance gain 4 the new attitude allows the crew to fly a less complicated flight path if they had to execute one of the more dangerous abort maneuvers the return to launch site decreased abort maneuver complexity 5 the new attitude improves the ability for ground based radio antennae to have a good line of sight signal with the s band radio antennae on the orbiter improved s band look angles 6 the new attitude allows the crew to see the horizon which is a helpful but not mandatory part of piloting any flying machine 7 the new attitude orients the shuttle so that the body is more nearly parallel with the ground and the nose to the east usually this allows the thrust from the engines to add velocity in the correct direction to eventually achieve orbit remember velocity is a vector quantity made of both speed and direction the shuttle has to have a large horizontal component to its velocity and a very small vertical component to attain orbit this all begs the question why isn t the launch pad oriented to give this nice attitude to begin with why does the shuttle need to roll to achieve that attitude the answer is that the pads were leftovers from the apollo days the shuttle straddles two flame trenches one for the solid rocket motor exhaust one for the space shuttle main engine exhaust you can see the effects of this on any daytime launch the srm exhaust is dirty gray garbage and the ssme exhaust is fluffy white steam watch for the difference between the top orbiter side and the bottom external tank side of the stack the access tower and other support and service structure are all oriented basically the same way they were for the saturn v s a side note the saturn v s also had a roll program don t ask me why i m a shuttle guy i checked with a buddy in ascent dynamics he added that the roll maneuver is really a maneuver in all three axes roll pitch and yaw the roll component of that maneuver is performed for the reasons stated the pitch component controls loading on the wings by keeping the angle of attack q alpha within a tight tolerance the yaw component is used to determine the orbital inclination the total maneuver is really expressed as a quaternion a grad level math concept for combining all three rotation matrices in one four element array how to receive

1 | back in the 70 s i was a service technician for a cash register company the cash registers used microprocessor circuits and back then they were very susceptible to electrostatic discharge and line noise the biggest problems came from outlets that were not properly grounded in almost every place we went to do an installation we found outlets with the ground connected to the neutral for 99 9 of the things you can plug into one of these they work fine for our cash registers they were a nightmare line noise tended to scramble the memory periodically with modern electronics using switching power supplies this should be less of a problem even the company i used to work for is no longer recommending a dedicated line with a seperate ground for their equipment i imagine if you check most household wiring you will find that the ground and neutral are connected although not ideal it should be o k for most applications slmr 2 1 my reality check just bounced

1 | i am trying to build a circuit that detects the presence of video vs a blank screen by monitoring the r g and b outputs of a graphics card it should be able to detect the presence of a single pixel at 65 mhz which would mean detecting a 15 ns pulse it should also be able to tell the difference between a blank screen about 300 mv and a dim screen say around 310 mv oh yes it also needs to be cheap my first circuit was a dismal failure i used 3 compariators each compariator had the input going to one of the guns the input went to a reference created by a voltage divider a potentiometer the first problem was that the compariator was way too slow i needed to get several pixels in a row before it would fire the compariators so i could have a whole screen full of text but my circuit would not detect it the second problem is that there was more noise on the reference then the smallest difference between a blank screen and a dim screen in fact the difference between completely black and completely white is only 650 mv i am wondering if i am going to have to amplify the video signals to make this work there are faster compariators but they are expensive and require split supplies i would need to replace my 49 quad compariator with three 1 89 compariators and create a whole new power supply circuit at this point i think what i need is some sort of transistor circuit transistors are fast and cheap and should do the trick unfortunately i am way out of my league when it comes to designing transistor circuits so i am appealing to the net for help any ideas tips circuits pointers references etc would be greatly appreciated oh yes i only sample the output of this thing every second or so so i don t need a fast response time at all however i haven t found a way to take advantage of that fact thanks a lot for any help anybody might be able to give of course you will have my undying gratitude steve verity

3 | i ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest i ve transcribed some of my notes below since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine permission is granted to copy this without restriction note for newbies the delta clipper project is geared towards producing a single staget to orbit reusable launch vehicle the dc x vehicle is a 1 3 scale vehicle designed to test some of the concepts invovled in ssto it is currently undergoing tests the dc y vehicle would be a full scale experimental vehicle capable of reaching orbit it has not yet been funded on april 6th rocky nelson of macdonnell douglas gave a talk entitled optimizing techniques for advanced space missions here at the university of illinois mr nelson s job involves using software to simulate trajectories and determine the optimal trajectory within given requirements although he is not directly involved with the delta clipper project he has spent time with them recently using his software for their applications he thus used the dc y project for most of his examples while i don t think the details of implicit trajectory simulation are of much interest to the readers i hope they aren t i fell asleep during that part i think that many of you will be interested in some of the details gleaned from the examples the first example given was the maximization of payload for a polar orbit the main restriction is that acceleration must remain below 3 gs i assume that this is driven by passenger constraints rather than hardware constraints but i did not verify that the delta clipper y version has 8 engines 4 boosters and 4 sustainers the boosters which have a lower isp are shut down in mid flight thus one critical question is when to shut them down mr nelson showed the following plot of acceleration vs time ______ 3 g as ascii graphs go this is actually fairly good the big difference is that the lines 2 g made by the should be curves which are concave up the data is only approximate as the graph wasn t up for very long 1 g 0 g 100 sec 400 sec as mentioned before a critical constraint is that g levels must be kept below 3 initially all eight engines are started as the vehicle burns fuel the accelleration increases as it gets close to 3g the booster engines are throtled back however they quickly become inefficient at low power so it soon makes more sense to cut them off altogether this causes the dip in accelleration at about 100 seconds eventually the remaining sustainer engines bring the g level back up to about 3 and then hold it there until they cut out entirely the engine cutoff does not acutally occur in orbit the trajectory is aimed for an altitude slightly higher than the 100nm desired and the last vestiges of air drag slow the vehicle slightly thus lowering the final altitude to that desired questions from the audience paraphrased q would it make sense to shut down the booster engines in pairs rather than all at once a very perceptive worth considering they have not yet done the simulation shutting down all four was part of the problem as given q so what was the final payload for this trajectory a can t tell us read aviation leak he also apparently had a good propulsion example but was told not to use it my question does anyone know if this security is due to sdio protecting national security or md protecting their own interests the second example was reentry simulation from orbit to just before the pitch up maneuver the biggest constraint in this one is aerodynamic heating and the parameter they were trying to maximize was crossrange he showed graphs of heating using two different models to show that both were very similar and i think we were supposed to assume that this meant they were very accurate the end result was that for a polar orbit landing at ksc the dc y would have about 30 degrees of crossrange and would start it s reentry profile about 60 degrees south latitude i would have asked about the landing maneuvers but he didn t know about that aspect of the flight profile

2 | reply to daniel prince f129 n102 z1 calcom socal com daniel prince yes it seems to work equally well for cfs another hint that these may be different facets of the same underlying process yes the benefit is usually evident within a few days of starting it most of the patients for whom it has worked well continued low dose amitriptyline daily aerobic excersise and a regular sleep schedule current standard therapy because of the cost usually 150 mo depending on dose and potential for significant side effects like corneal injury and birth defects i currently reserve it for those who fail conventional treatment it is important that the person prescribing it have some experience with it and follow the patient closely as far as i know i am the only person looking at it currently i should get off my duff and finish writing up some case reports i m not an academic physician so i don t feel the pressure to publish or perish and i don t have the time during the work day for such things

1 | i think you posted your article 15 days too late april 1st is over i don t like nuclear powerplants but i think it s not fair to tell such storys about them ok let me try to explain what that tower is used to 1st even the modernst nuclear powerplant is only a simple steam engine it has an hightech boiler but the rest is still verry verry conventional and if you ve already visited any condensation powerstation you l have seen the cooling towers too if you look at any good book about thermophysics you ll find a chapter about the carnot process which describes how to get energy from a temperature difference and that is the reason for cooling towers too you only can get energy if you ve an temperature gradient that means that you have steam on the one side and need to cool down the steam till you get water again on the other side if you want to get aprox 30 of the energy you or better the uranium brought into the water to let it boil if you only have hot steam on the one and cold steam on the other side you ll loose much more of the energy and so they cool down the steam to get at least the 30 of energy that carnot will give them the cooling towers are for cooling the steam the vapor you ll see is not the steam of the main core circulation because that steam is radioactive the circulation is divided in at least 2 circuits connected about heat exchangers to prevent radioactive pollution of the environment 2nd ok the main core is hot but even in the modernst hightemperature reactors htr they only run at 800 deg celsius this is still verry far away from uraniums melting point which is somewhere around 2000 deg celsius but you ll have lot s of problems with the boiler s steel that s because at this temperature the metal is attacked by steam and will corrode verry fast this is only for bwr s the new he cooled reactors have temperatures up to 1200 deg celsius but this is only experimental 3rd i personaly think that nuclear waste should be as low as ever possible because the dose you get will accumulate about the years today 1 mrem and next year 0 5 mrem won t be 0 75 mrem at all it accumulates and even in 80 years you ll still have 1 5 mrem and i m not interested in glowing in the night and getting children with 2 heads this is my point of view only my 0 02 christian reisel student of electronic sciences christian reisel goldammerweg 2 w 6601 buebingen germany voice 49 6805 22179 fax email 49 6805 22179 pgp pubkey

2 | gordon banks this certainly describes my situation perfectly for me there is a constant dynamic between my tendency to eat which appears to be totally limitless and the purely conscious desire to not put on too much weight when i get too fat i just diet exercise more with varying degrees of success to take off the extra weight usually i cycle within a 15 lb range but smaller and larger cycles occur as well i m always afraid that this method will stop working someday but usually i seem to be able to hold the weight gain in check this is one reason i have a hard time accepting the notion of some metabolic derangement associated with cycle dieting that results in long term weight gain i have been cycle dieting for at least 20 years without seeing such a change i think a vigorous exercise program can go a long way toward keeping the cycles smaller and the baseline weight low

2 | recurrent volvulus this is regarding recurrent volvulus which our little boy has been suffering from ever since he was an infant he had a surgery when he was one year old another surgery had to be performed one year after when he was two years old he turned three this february and he is still getting afflicted by this illness like having to get hospitalised for vomitting and accompanying stomach pain he managed not having a third surgery so far one thing me and my wife noticed is that his affliction peaks around the time he was born on nearabouts like in march every year any significance to this why does this recur me and my family go through severe pain when our little boy have to undergo surgery why does surgery not rectify the situation also which hospital in us or canada specialize in this malady what will be a good book explaining this disease in detail will keeping a particular diet keep down the probability of recurrence as time goes on will the probability of recurrence go down considering he is getting stronger and healthier and probably less prone to attacks or is this assumption wrong any help throwing light on these queries will be highly appreciated thanks very much

3 | you totally forgot the original post that you posted allen in that post you stated that the wrap was on top of and in addition to any overhead geez in this post you finally admit that this is not true come your little ol buns down here and you will find out who is doing what and who is working on integration this is simply an ad hominum attack and you know it of course there is a fee it is for administration geez allen any organization has costs but there is a heck of a difference in legitimate costs such as libraries and other things that must be there to support a program and wrap as you originally stated it you stated that wrap was on top of all of the overhead which a couple of sentences down you say is not true which is it allen as you have posted on this subject allen you state that wrap is over and above overhead and is a seperate charge you admit here that this is wrong nasa has a line item budget every year i have seen it allen get some numbers from that detailed nasa budget and dig out the wrap numbers and then howl to high heaven about it until you do that you are barking in the wind integration could be done better at the centers apollo integration was done here at msfc and that did not turn out so bad the philosophy of reston is totally wrong allen there you have a bunch of people who are completely removed from the work that they are trying to oversee there is no way that will ever work it has never worked in any large scale project that it was ever tried on could you imagine a reston like set up for apollo oh you are full of it allen on this one i agree that jsc screwed up big they should be responsible for that screw up and the people that caused it replaced to make a stupid statement like that just shows how deep your bias goes come to msfc for a couple of weeks and you will find out just how wrong you really are maybe not people like you believe exactly what they want to believe no matter what the facts are contrary to it i agree that integration is the single most important part of a successful large scale effort what i completly disagree with is seperating that integration function from the people that are doing the work it is called leadership allen that is what made apollo work final responsibility for the success of apollo was held by less than 50 people that is leadership and responsibility there is neither when you have any organization set up as reston is you could take the same people and move them to jsc or msfc and they could do a much better job why did it take a year for reston to finally say something about the problem if they were on site and part of the process then the problem would have never gotten out of hand in the first place there is one heck of a lot i do not know allen but one thing i do know is that for a project to be successful you must have leadership i remember all of the turn over at reston that kept ssf program in shambles for years do you it is lack of responsibility and leadership that is the programs problem lack of leadership from the white house congress and at reston nasa is only a symptom of a greater national problem you are so narrowly focused in your efforts that you do not see this no i am saying that if they were located at jsc it never would have happened in the first place i have the time to reitereate one more timet that if the leadership that is at reston was on site at jsc the problem never would have happened totally ignoring the lack of leadership of congress this many headed hydra that has grown up at nasa is the true problem of the agency and to try to change the question to suit you and your bias is only indicative of your position

1 | hams can legally run up to 1500 watts it is very unlikely however that a ham would be running that kind of power from a car ham rigs for cars put out around 100 watts it is possible that a 100 watt radio would cause interference to consumer electronic 100 feet away most tvs stereos and vcrs have very poor rf shielding if you experience the problem frequently it may be caused by a ham cber or other radio operator in a base station nearby the interference may have been caused by a radio transmitter used for other purposes such as police fire etc if you heard voices over your stereo i think you are correct in assuming that the source is an rf transmitter if you have frequent trouble you may want to try the rf ferrite chokes available at radio shack the interference is probably being picked up by your speaker wires and those chokes can be installed on the wires very easily without cutting them good instructions are included with the chokes if that does not solve the problem you may want to search your neighborhood for a radio operator look for antennas on the roof or car talk to him her about your problem there are things a radio operator can do to reduce interference

2 | my wife s ob gyn has an ultrasound machine in her office when the doctor couldn t hear a fetal heartbeat 13 weeks she used the ultrasound to see if everything was ok it was on her next visit my wife asked another doctor in the office if they read the ultrasounds themselves or if they had a radiologist read the pictures the doctor very vehemently insisted that they were qualified to read the ultrasound and radiologists were not my wife is concerned about this she saw a tv show a couple months back something like 20 20 or dateline nbc etc where an expert on fetal ultrasounds a radiologist was showing all the different deffects that could be detected using the ultrasound should my wife be concerned should we take the pictures to a radiologist for a second opinion and if so where would we find such an expert in chicago we don t really have any special medical reason to be concerned but if a radiologist will be able to see things the ob gyn can t then i don t see why we shouldn t use one any thoughts

3 | actually hiten wasn t originally intended to go into lunar orbit at all so it indeed didn t have much fuel on hand the lunar orbit mission was an afterthought after hagoromo a tiny subsatellite deployed by hiten during a lunar flyby had a transmitter failure and its proper insertion into lunar orbit couldn t be positively confirmed it should be noted that the technique does have disadvantages it takes a long time and you end up with a relatively inconvenient lunar orbit if you want something useful like a low circular polar orbit you do have to plan to expend a certain amount of fuel although it is reduced from what you d need for the brute force approach

2 | a friend of mine is having some symptoms and has asked me to post the following information a few weeks ago she noticed that some of her hair was starting to fall out she would touch her head and strands of hair would just fall right out by the way she is 29 or 30 years old it continued to occur until she had a bald spot about the size of a half dollar since that time she has gotten two more bald spots of the same size other symptoms she s described include several months of an irregular menstrual cycle which is strange for her because she has always been extremely regular laryngitis every few days she will wake up one morning and have almost no voice and then the next day it s fine dizzy spells she claims that she s had 4 or 5 very bad dizzy spells early in the morning including one that knocked her to the ground and general fatigue she went to a dermatologist first who couldn t find any reason for the symptoms and sent her to an internist who suspected thyroid problems he did the blood work and claims that everything came back normal she s very concerned and very confused does anyone have any ideas or suggestions i told her that i thought she should see an endocrinologist does that sound like the right idea by the way in case you are going to ask no she has recently taken any medications that would cause these symptoms no she hasn t recently changed her hair products and she hasn t gotten a perm coloring or other chemical process that might cause hair to fall out

3 | the hga isn t all that reflective in the wavelengths that might cook the focal elements nor is its figure good on those scales the problem is that the antenna _itself_ could not be exposed to venus level sunlight lest like icarus wings it melt i think it was glues and such as well as electronics that they were worried about thus it had to remain furled and the axis _always_ pointed near the sun so that the small sunshade at the tip of the antenna mast would shadow the folded hga a larger sunshade beneath the antenna shielded the spacecraft bus

3 | well lets see i took a class on this last fall and i have no notes so i ll try to wing it here s how i understand it remember from stellar evolution that black holes and neutron stars pulsars are formed from high mass stars m star 1 4m sun high mass stars live fast and burn hard taking appoximately 10 5 10 7 years before going nova or supernova in this time they don t live long enough to get perturbed out of the galactic plane so any of these if assumed to be the sources of grb s will be in the plane of the galaxy then we take the catalog of bursts that have been recieved from the various satellites around the solar system pioneer venus has one either pion 10 or 11 ginga and of course batse and we do distribution tests on our catalog these tests all show that the bursts have an isotropic distribution evenly spread out in a radial direction and they show signs of homogeneity i e they do not clump in any one direction so unless we are sampling the area inside the disk of the galaxy we are sampling the universe not cool if you want to figure out what the hell caused these things now i suppose you are saying well we stil only may be sampling from inside the disk well not necessarily remember we have what is more or less an interplanetary network of burst detectors with a baseline that goes waaaay out to beyond pluto pioneer 11 so we should be able with all of our detectors de tect some sort of difference in angle from satellite to satellite here s an analogy you see a plane overhead you measure the angle of the plane from the origin of your arbitrary coordinate system one of your friends a mile away sees the same plane and measures the angle from the zero point of his arbitrary system which is the same as yours the two angles are different and you should be able to triangulate the position of your burst and maybe find a source to my knowledge no one has been able to do this i should throw in why halo and corona models don t work also as i said before looking at the possible astrophysics of the bursts short timescales high energy black holes and pulsars exhibit much of this type of behavior if this is the case as i said before these stars seem to be bound to the disk of the galaxy especially the most energetic of the these sources when you look at a simulated model where the bursts are confined to the disk but you sample out to large distances say 750 mpc you should definitely see not only an anisotropy towards you in all direction but a clumping of sources in the direction of the galactic center as i said before there is none of these characteristics

1 | here in switzerland the situation is exactly the same the cable tv companies even tried to stop amateur radio in switzerland in the beginning of cable tv they seem to be too stupid to know anything about international frequency conferences or so even today they use the cheapest possible coax running into problems they can t solve anymore as bill noted the only way is to look for a solution with the neighbours before calling for the cable tv guys or the fcc the chance to find neighbours with some sense for reason is by far bigger than with these people especially the first ones as anywhere in an administration people don t like if you tell them to work for the money they get the problem is that radio amateurs don t have the power to put trough their rights in all cases so let s hope they start soon with optical fibers and get out of our freqencies cheers robert hb9nby
1 | true especially for electrolytic capacitors at high temperature low power quartz oscillators are usually 32 khz and these have significant temperature drifts which one doesn t often notice while wearing the watch on one s wrist low temperature sensitivity is available in other crystal types which unfortunately are larger and higher frequency 1 mhz or so and take more battery power programmable timers might be less accurate but they are more power stingy than suitable crystal oscillators

1 | no no nooo the ground green wire is for safety no current is supposed to flow in it under normal conditions this means that there s normally no voltage drop in it either it is supposed to be safe to touch the ground wire even if you re grounded in some other way at the same time the neutral white wire is as dave vanderbyl correctly said the return for the hot wire since current flows in it there s a voltage drop if you plug a heavy load into a properly wired grounded outlet you can commonly measure a volt or so of difference between neutral and ground they are supposed to be connected together at the breaker panel but nowhere repeat nowhere else well almost there are strange exceptions for things like sub panels what you can do if you want three prong outlets without additional wiring is to use a gfci outlet or breaker but the outlet will be cheaper in fact depending on where you are putting your new outlet s a gfci may be required there is a faq on electrical wiring posted regularly to rec woodworking and news answers it goes into great detail on these issues including gfcis and you should probably read it before asking any more questions i ll mail a copy to you append a copy here and will ask the writers to cross post it here in the future

1 | thus a decibell deci l tenth of bell is a fractional part of the original bell for example southwestern bell is a decibell and the measure of current amp is actually named after both the amp company and the amphenol company both companies revolutionized electronics by simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets were affected by the amount of current running through the wires the ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers thus our use of the ohms alexander graham bell actually is where bell came from actually bel refers

1 | as a general rule no relay will cleanly switch audio if you try to tranfer the circuit with the contacts the noise you hear is due to the momentary opening and closing of the path the noiseless way of transfering audio is to ground the circuit in high impedance audio circuits a resistive t is constructed close to characteristic impedance of the circuit grounding the imputs connected to the t transfers the audio in low impedance circuits transformers are usually used and the inputs are shorted out or grounded secondaries are paralleled at the characteristic impedance sometimes if it is necessary to actually switch audio a second contact is used to momentarily short the circuit output for the duration of the switching time telephone relays are handy because contacts can be adjusted to make before break and vica versa but i haven t seen any of these for years nowadys switching is done electronically with op amps etc a novel circuit i used to build was a primitive optical isolator it consists of a resistive photocell and a lamp all packaged in a tube when the lamp is off the cell is high resistance turn the lamp on and the resistance lowers passing the audio once again this device in a t switches the audio varying the lamp resistance give a remote volume control use 2 variable resisters and you have a mixer lots of luck 73 tom tom wagner audio visual technician malaspina college nanaimo british columbia 604 753 3245 loc 2230 fax 755 8742 callsign ve7gda weapon 45 kentucky rifle snail mail to site q4 c2 rr 4 nanaimo british columbia canada v9r 5x9

2 | i attribute my success to several factors very low fat except when someone else has cooked a meal for me i only eat fruit vegetables and whole grain or bran cereals i estimate i only get about 5 to 10 percent of my calories from fat very little sugar or salt very high fiber most americans get about 10 grams 25 to 35 are recommended i get between 50 and 150 sometimes 200 i ve heard of people taking fiber pills it seems unlikely that pills can contain enough fiber to make a difference it would be about as likely as someone getting fat by popping fat pills tablets are just too small unless you snarf down hundreds of them daily my clean your plate conditioning works for me eating the last 10 takes half my eating time and gives satiety a chance to catch up so i don t still feel hungry and go start eating something else i don t eat when i m not hungry unless i m sure i ll get hungry shortly and eating won t be practical then i bike to work 22 miles a day year round fast i also bike to stores movies and everywhere else as i ve never owned a car i estimate this burns about 1000 calories a day it also helps build and maintain muscle mass prevent insulin resistance diabetes runs in my family and increase my metabolism even so my metabolism is so low that when i m at rest i m most comfortable with a temperature in the 90s f and usually wear a sweater if it drops to 80 cycling also motivates me to avoid every excess ounce cyclists routinely pay a premium for cycling products that weigh slightly less than others but it s easier and cheaper to trim weight from the rider than from the vehicle there s no question in my mind that my metabolism is radically different from that of most people who have never been fat fortunately it isn t different in a way that precludes excellent health obviously i can t swear that every obese person who does what i ve done will have the success i did but i ve never yet heard of one who did try it and didn t succeed i m sure everyone s weight cycles whether or not they ve ever been fat i usually eat extremely little salt when i do eat something salty my weight can increase overnight by as much as ten pounds it comes off again over a week or two keith lynch kfl access digex com
2 | i posted this to sci psychology on april 3 and after seeing your post here on panice disorder thought it would be relevant my research indicates that two schools of thought exist the literature promoting medication says it s the superior treatment not surprisingly literature promoting cognitive therapy also claims to be superior what are the facts early in my research i didn t have a bias towards either medication or cognitive therapy i was interested in a treatment that worked after reading journals published after 1986 the cognitive therapy camp claims a higher success rate approx 80 a lower drop out rate and no side effects associated with medication lars goran ost published an excellent article titled applied relaxation description of a coping technique and a review of controlled studies this is from behav res ther vol 25 no 5 pp 397 409 1987 the article provides instructions on how to perform applied relaxation ar briefly you start with two 15 minute sessions daily and progress in 8 12 weeks to performing 10 15 thirty second sessions daily i ll snail mail this article to anyone interested usa only please international please pay for postage
2 | the danger in philosophizing about science is that theory and generalization can end up being far removed from the actual day to day of the grunt at the bench yes its great to be involved in a process were i can walk into the lab after a heavy night of dreaming and just do something for the hell of it as long as my advisor doesn t catch me which is easy enough to do but stamping out such behavior seems to be the purpose in life of grant review committees and the peer review process in general in today s world that s what determines what science is what gets funded and a damn good thing to flights of fantasy just don t have much chance of producing anything at least not in biomedical research the surest way for a graduate student to ruin their life is to work in a lab where the boss is more concerned with fleshing out his her fantasies than with having the student work on a project that actually has a good chance of producing some results md s seem to be particularly prone to this aberrant behavior i have to agree with gary merrill s response to this i ve read alot of the alu and middle repetitive sequence work and it s really very interesting good work with implications for many fields in molecular genetics it s really an example of how a well reasoned project turned up interesting results that were unexpected

may not apply to you in general however systems connected to the net fall in one of three categories internet usenet or bitnet electronic mail may be sent between these networks and other resources available on one of these networks are sometimes accessible from other networks by email sent to special servers the space and astronomy discussion groups actually are composed of several mechanisms with mostly transparent connections between them one mechanism is the mailing list in which mail is sent to a central distribution point which relays it to all recipients of the list in addition to the general lists for space called space digest for internet users and space on bitnet there are a number of more specialized mailing lists described below a second mechanism is usenet netnews this is somewhat like a bulletin board operating on each system which is a part of the net netnews separates contributions into hundreds of different categories based on a group name the groups dealing most closely with space topics are called sci space news sci space sci space shuttle sci astro and talk politics space contributors post submissions called articles in netnews terminology on their local machine which sends it to other nearby machines similarly articles sent from nearby machines are stored locally and may be forwarded to other systems so that an article is posted locally and eventually reaches all the usenet sites interested in receiving the news group to which the article was posted gateway machines redirect the usenet sci space group into internet and bitnet mailing lists and vice versa the other usenet groups are not accessible as mailing lists if you can receive netnews its more flexible interface and access to a wider range of material usually make it the

2 | if you could not tell which one had msg why restaurants bother to use it at all if you can taste the difference psychological reaction might play a role the fact is msg is part of natural substance everyone i mean everyone consumes certain amount of msg every day through regular diet without the synthesized msg additive chinese and many other asians japanese koreans etc have used msg as flavor enhancer for two thousand years do you believe that they knew how to make msg from chemical processes not they just extracted it from natural food such sea food and meat broth baring msg is just like baring sugar which many people react to
3 | here is a way to get the commericial companies into space and mineral exploration basically get the eci freaks to make it so hard to get the minerals on earth you think this is crazy well in a way it is but in a way it is reality there is a billin the congress to do just that basically to make it so expensive to mine minerals in the us unless you can by off the inspectors or tax collectors ascially what i understand from talking to a few miner friends of mine that they the congress propose to have a tax on the gross income of the mine versus the adjusted income also the state governments have there normal taxes so by the time you get done paying for materials workers and other expenses you can owe more than what you made basically if you make a 1000 00 and spend 500 ofor expenses you can owe 600 00 in federal taxes bascially it is driving the miners off the land and the only peopel who benefit are the eco freaks basically to get back to my beginning statement is space is the way to go cause it might just get to expensive to mine on earth because of either the eco freaks or the protectionist such fun we have in these interesting times

2 | i am posting to this group in hopes of finding someone out there in network newsland who has heard of something similar to what i am going to describe here i have a fourteen year old daugter who experienced a seizure on november 3 1992 at 6 45am after eating kellog s frosted flakes she is perfectly healthy had never experienced anything like this before and there is no history of seizures in either side of the family all the tests eeg mri ekg came out negative so the decision was made to do nothing and just wait to see if it happened again well we were going along fine and the other morning april 5 she had a bowl of another kellog s frosted kind of cereal fruit loops i am embarrassed to admit that i even bought that junk but every once in a while so i pour it in her bowl and think oh oh this is the same kind of junk she was eating when she had that seizure ten minutes later she had a full blown seizures this was her first exposure to a sugar coated cereal since the last seizure when i mentioned what she ate the first time as a possible reason for the seizure the neurologist basically negated that as an idea now after this second episode so similar in nature to the first even he is scratching his head once again her eeg looks normal which i understand can happen even when a person has a seizure once again we are waiting i have been thinking that it would be good to get to as large a group as possible to see if anyone has any experience with this kind of thing i know that members of the medical community are sometimes loathe to admit the importance that diet and foods play in our general health and well being anyway as you can guess i am worried sick about this and would appreciate any ideas anyone out there has sorry to be so wordy but i wanted to really get across what is going on here thanks
1 | he ones i have seen are all fluorescent tubes maybe you could find a small tube to go in one of those hand held fluoro lanterns blue lights ultra violet by definition goes from the blue end of the spectrum that people see to the radio spectrum x rays cosmic rays etc possibly you could get light at the fringe of visibility which people with false eye lenses can see easily since it s your lenses that soak up most of the uv however since most people use uv to get other things to glow and the near blue is less energetic it would probably not work as well if it worked at all lecture on basic atomic physics fits in here about electron transitions quantum leaps and stuff
2 | unfortunately hep b infection can eventuate in chronic hepatitis and subsequent cirrhosis although not many patients with hep b go on to chronic hepatitis it does still occur in a good number 20 and is something to keep in mind hepatitis c was non a non b hep much more frequently leads to chronic hep and cirrhosis there is also an autimmune chronic hepatitis that affects mostly younger women which also leads to cirrhosis of course cirrhosis is a most unkind disease the most dangerous effects relate to portal hypertension and loss of liver function patients develop life threatening variceal bleeds and hepatic comas among many other problems as a result of disturbances in hepatic circulation less ominously they can exhibit the effects of hyperestrogenemia which often characterize patients with cirrhosis these effects include telangiactasias small red skin lesions and in men gynecomastia breast development the only real treatment for cirrhosis is liver transplant keep in mind that cirrhosis is not expected at least statistically in your friend s case nevertheless you might want to bring up the subject of chronic disease and cirrhosis with the doctor hopefully he or she can then carefully explain these sequelae of hep b infection to you and offer you support
1 | with relays alone you will always get a transient when you abruptly turn on or off any channel if you don t want to hear the transient use some other device a photoresistor output optoisolator is the usual sort of thing to gently mute the signal then switch then remove the power from the lamp in the optoisolator it used to be standard practice to employ photoresistors in switching audio because the photoresistor time delay a few thousandths of a second kept any noise in the digital side which drives the lamp from contaminating the audio and the devices are cheaper than relays

3 | my poor old physics intuition will be very surprised if these tiny masses sitting very close to jupiter play any role whatsoever in the problem or to put it more technically the extra volume they add to the phase space of possible capture trajectories is negligible jupiter is 2e27 kg while the galilean satellites are around 1e23 also as i said the few references that i ve looked at do not mention outgassing or breakup as important processes the important thing is a jupiter sun comet reverse slingshot that leads to a weakly jupiter bound orbit for the comet at least a temporary one
3 | i note that you make no such case as you claim can be even more easily made yes the argument can and has been made that current government policy creates even larger market barriers than there were in the first place but there is no such term as government failure since the government can change policies whenever it pleases the market doesn t do that and is governed by relatively well understood forces this libertopican bilge about moral arguments about taxation etc is at bottom so much simplistic economic thinking it can only be justified by cliche derision of anyone who knows more about economics than the libertopian which is what invariably happens tripe a la tommy the new libertopian dish wherever do you get this inflated idea of your own importance insisting on perfect safety is for people who don t have the balls to live in the real world mary shafer nasa ames dryden

3 | the current mining regulations and fees were set in the 1800 s what the so called eco freaks want to do is to simply bring those fees in line with current economic reality currently mining companies can get access to minerals on public lands for ridiculously low prices something like 50 the mining lobby has for decades managed to block any reform of these outdated fees in fact the latest attempt to reform them was again blocked president clinton compromised by taking the mining fee reforms out of his 94 budget and plans to draft separate legislation to fight that battle if you want to discuss this further i suggest you take this to talk environment

3 | this is turning into what s a moonbase good for and i ought not to post when i ve a hundred some odd posts to go but i would think that the real reason to have a moon base is economic since someone with space industry will presumeably have a much larger gnp than they would _without_ space industry eventually they will simply be able to afford more stuff if i read you right you re saying in essence that with a larger economy nations will have more discretionary funds to waste on a lunar facility that was certainly partially the case with apollo but real lunar colonies will probably require a continuing military scientific or commercial reason for being rather than just a we have the money why not approach ah but the whole point is that money spent on a lunar base is not wasted on the moon it s not like they d be using 1000 1000r bills to fuel their moon dozers the money to fund a lunar base would be spent in the country to which the base belonged it s a way of funding high tech research just like darpa was a good excuse to fund various fields of research under the pretense that it was crucial to the defense of the country or like esprit is a good excuse for the ec to fund research under the pretense that it s good for pan european cooperation now maybe you think that government funded research is a waste of money in fact i m pretty sure you do but it does count as investment spending which does boost the economy and just look at the size of that multiplier

1 | my next project is to come up with an if detector module for fast 112 to 250 kb sec packet radio use no fancy modulation scheme just wide fsk for use at 902 or 1296 mhz i m a bit familiar with the motorola 3362 chip but i wonder if there are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies my goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver back end with if input on one end and an fsk demondulator on the other i m particularly interested in ways to use a higher if than 10 7 do any current chips work up to say 150mhz with internal downconversion so a normal if filter can be used any suggestions john what you describe is very close to what i built and described in the 10th arrl computer network conference proceedings i built 10 watt fsk transceivers at 904 mhz they are essentially double conversion transverters with digital mod and demod at 29 mhz the receiver uses the mc13055 which is the same fsk receiver chip i used previouslyu in the 2 mbps 10 ghz data link i first published in ham radio and which is now also in the arrl handbook the mc3356 which includes a vhf converter section could also be used at these speeds there is a newer and perhaps slightly improved design of this the mc13056 if i remember rightly while using this would have let me reduce the external if count on receive it didn t really offer all that much help on transmit so i didn t bother with it the radios i built were first designed and built for 512 kbps in a 2 mhz channel but later reduced to half that these 256 kbps radios actually have done quite well in across the bench tests at 384 kbps and speed is pretty much a function of filter design handling the data stream is another matter entirely some of the existing radios are currently deployed on hilltops in a beacon test mode while there is not yet end end two way data flow due to lack of resources to debug software for the digital hardware mio also shown in the cnc proceedings data is perfect copy at n6gn even though the data clock is currently at about half speed the a 2 kbytes of the test text chapter 55 of isaiah takes only a little over 1 8 of a second i ve been hoping that someone would get interested enough to step in and get involved in writing code to make the whole thing usable borland ide environment with remote debugging possible as mentioned in the proceedings but to date a couple of us have been on our own and running low on resources of time money and energy if anyone in the sf bay area wants to check it out there is also a cw id after the text on the mark side at 904 740 mhz from beacons on sonoma mtn and black mtn overlooking si valley the antenna is horizontally polarized i guess in retrospect my suggestions are that this is a fairly costly approach if the radios are intended for users rather than backbones and you might want to carefully consider your target if you can t arrange your paths such that you have complete line of sight i think you ll want to address the inter symbol interference caused by multipath and probably link c n budgets if paths are very far from los for more details see the 10th cnc i m currently working on a spread spectrum direct conversion design to address some of these problems i d be glad to help as i can with any design problems 73 glenn elmore n6gn

1 | one thing to consider is time division multiplexing the emg channels to reduce the number of rf carriers you have to generate if you multiplexed the emg inputs at 10khz that would probably be sufficient for most physiology studies you d have 330 hz per channel sampling rate that level of analog multiplexing should be rather easy to accomplish combining a lot of rf carriers is pretty tricky to do without generating intermodulation a system to be carried by a runner is in a fairly harsh environment and would probably be difficult to keep balanced a commercial hand held transciever could probably be employed with a little modification to accomodate widening the bandwidth obviously this has to be done in accordance with whatever laws govern the use of transeivers in your location

astronaut a we will assume you mean a nasa astronaut since it s probably impossible for a non russian to get into the cosmonaut corps paying passengers are not professional cosmonauts and the other nations have so few astronauts and fly even fewer that you re better off hoping to win a lottery becoming a shuttle pilot requires lots of fast jet experience which means a military flying career forget that unless you want to do it anyway so you want to become a shuttle mission specialist if you aren t a us citizen become one that is a must after that the crucial thing to remember is that the demand for such jobs vastly exceeds the supply nasa s problem is not finding qualified people but thinning the lineup down to manageable length it is not enough to be qualified you must avoid being dis qualified for any reason many of them in principle quite irrelevant to the job get a ph d specialize in something that involves getting your hands dirty with equipment not just paper and pencil forget computer programming entirely it will be done from the ground for the fore seeable future degree s in one field plus work experience in another seems to be a frequent winner be in good physical condition with good eyesight do not get a radial keratomy or similar hack to improve your vision nobody knows what sudden pressure changes would do to rked eyes and long term effects are poorly understood for that matter avoid any other significant medical unknowns if you can pass a jet pilot physical you should be okay if you can t your chances are poor practise public speaking and be conservative and conformist in appearance and actions you ve got a tough selling job ahead trying to convince a cautious conservative selection committee that you are better than hundreds of other applicants and also that you will be a credit to nasa after you are hired public relations is a significant part of the job and nasa s image is very prim and proper the image you want is squeaky clean workaholic yuppie remember also that you will need a security clearance at some point and security considers everybody guilty until proven innocent keep your nose clean get a pilot s license and make flying your number one hobby experienced pilots are known to be favored even for non pilot jobs work for nasa of 45 astronauts selected between 1984 and 1988 43 were military or nasa employees and the remaining two were a nasa consultant and mae jemison the first black female astronaut if you apply from outside nasa and miss but they offer you a job at nasa take it sometimes in the past this has meant you do look interesting but we want to know you a bit better first think space they want highly motivated people so lose no chance to demonstrate motivation keep trying many astronauts didn t make it the first time nasa national aeronautics and space administration lyndon b johnson space center houston texas announcement for mission specialist and pilot astronaut candidates astronaut candidate program the national aeronautics and space administration nasa has a need for pilot astronaut candidates and mission specialist astronaut candidates to support the space shuttle program nasa is now accepting on a continuous basis and plans to select astronaut candidates as needed persons from both the civilian sector and the military services will be considered all positions are located at the lyndon b johnson space center in houston texas and will involved a 1 year training and evaluation program space shuttle program description the numerous successful flights of the space shuttle have demonstrated that operation and experimental investigations in space are becoming routine the space shuttle orbiter is launched into and maneuvers in the earth orbit performing missions lastling up to 30 days it then returns to earth and is ready for another flight with payloads and flight crew the orbiter performs a variety of orbital missions including deployment and retrieval of satellites service of existing satellites operation of specialized laboratories astronomy earth sciences materials processing manufacturing and other operations these missions will eventually include the development and servicing of a permanent space station the orbiter also provides a staging capability for using higher orbits than can be achieved by the orbiter itself users of the space shuttle s capabilities are both domestic and foreign and include government agencies and private industries the crew normally consists of five people the commander the pilot and three mission specialists on occasion additional crew members are assigned the commander pilot and mission specialists are nasa astronauts pilot astronaut pilot astronauts server as both space shuttle commanders and pilots during flight the commander has onboard responsibility for the vehicle crew mission success and safety in flight the pilot assists the commander in controlling and operating the vehicle in addition the pilot may assist in the deployment and retrieval of satellites utilizing the remote manipulator system in extra vehicular activities and other payload operations mission specialist astronaut mission specialist astronauts working with the commander and pilot have overall responsibility for the coordination of shuttle operations in the areas of crew activity planning consumables usage and experiment and payload operations mission specialists are required to have a detailed knowledge of shuttle systems as well as detailed knowledge of the operational characteristics mission requirements and objectives and supporting systems and equipment for each of the experiments to be conducted on their assigned missions mission specialists will perform extra vehicular activities payload handling using the remote manipulator system and perform or assist in specific experimental operations astronaut candidate program basic qualification requirements applicants must meet the following minimum

aviation management or similar fields application procedures civilian the application package may be obtained by writing to nasa johnson space center astronaut selection office attn ahx houston tx 77058 civilian applications will be accepted on a continuous basis when nasa decides to select additional astronaut candidates consideration will be given only to those applications on hand on the date of decision is made applications received after that date will be retained and considered for the next selection applicants will be notified annually of the opportunity to update their applications and to indicate continued interest in being considered for the program those applicants who do not update their applications annually will be dropped from consideration and their applications will not be retained after the preliminary screening of applications additional information may be requested for some applicants and person listed on the application as supervisors and references may be contacted active duty military active duty military personnel must submit applications to their respective military service and not directly to nasa application procedures will be disseminated by each service selection personal interviews and thorough medical evaluations will be required for both civilian and military applicants under final consideration once final selections have been made all applicants who were considered will be notified of the outcome of the process selection rosters established through this process may be used for the selection of additional candidates during a one year period following their establishment general program requirements selected applicants will be designated astronaut candidates and will be assigned to the astronaut office at the johnson space center houston texas the astronaut candidates will undergo a 1 year training and evaluation period during which time they will be assigned technical or scientific responsibilities allowing them to contribute substantially to ongoing programs they will also participate in the basic astronaut training program which is designed to develop the knowledge and skills required for formal mission training upon selection for a flight pilot astronaut candidates will maintain proficiency in nasa aircraft during their candidate period applicants should be aware that selection as an astronaut candidate does not insure selection as an astronaut final selection as an astronaut will depend on satisfactory completion of the 1 year training and evaluation period civilian candidates who successfully complete the training and evaluation and are selected as astronauts will become permanent federal employees and will be expected to remain with nasa for a period of at least five years civilian candidates who are not selected as astronauts may be placed in other positions within nasa depending upon agency requirements and manpower constraints at that time successful military candidates will be detailed to nasa for a specified tour of duty nasa has an affirmative action program goal of having qualified minorities and women among those qualified as astronaut candidates therefore qualified minorities and women are encouraged to apply pay and benefits civilians salaries for civilian astronaut candidates are based on the federal governments general schedule pay scales for grades gs 11 through gs 14 and are set in accordance with each individuals academic achievements and experience other benefits include vacation and sick leave a retirement plan and participation in group health and life insurance plans military selected military personnel will be detailed to the johnson space center but will remain in an active duty status for pay benefits leave and other similar military matters

3 | is it right that is new stuff for me so it means that you just can not put a sattellite around around the moon for too long because its orbit will be unstable if so what is the reason is that because the combined gravitacional atraction of the sun moon and earth that does not provide a stable orbit around the moon c o egalon larc nasa gov c o egalon larc nasa gov

1 | have anyone some idea about how to build a cheap low resolution or high video projector
2 | gee maybe i ve misjudged you russell anyone who agrees with something i say can t be all bad seriously i m not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes and i still disagree with your contention that nobody who doesn t use methods deemed scientific can possibly know what s true and what s not okay so let s see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful this is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support in this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i come to this dispute about what science is not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci psychology and occasionally in sci med about nlp neurolinguistic programming much of the work done to date by nlpers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research for years now i have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes courtesy of your local university library not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at the nlp methodology especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest and most especially to be aware of the questions nlp suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation over and over again the response i get in sci pychology is if this hasn t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can t be of any interest to us to me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme there ve got to be controlled studies position is an nlp technique called the fast phobia trauma cure simple phobias as opposed to agoraphobia may not be the world s most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that it doesn t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one the nlp phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than 15 minutes nlpers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence is useful in treating post traumatic stress syndrome it is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists a subject only needs to be taken through the technique once or in the case of ptsd once for each traumatic incident the process doesn t need to be repeated and the subject doesn t need to practice it over again at home now to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure especially if as nlpers claim the success rate is extremely high take someone with a fear of heights as i used to have take them up to a balcony on the 20th floor and observe their response spend 15 minutes to have them do the simple visualization send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting more long term follow up is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance in any case there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years to the best of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks my own cure incidentally was done with a slightly different nlp technique before i learned of the fast phobia trauma cure ten years later now i enjoy living on the 17th floor of my building and having a large balcony the folks over in sci psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since they re not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance the fast phobia trauma cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying we don t have any way of knowing that it s effective these academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want of course but they say why should i prove your theory and the burden of proof is on the one making the claim one academic in sci psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn t been described in a scientific journal it s described in a number of books and i ve posted articles in sci psychology describing it in as much detail as i m capable of actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it s apparently not acceptable because it s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal to me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it this is the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about science now maybe i have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you russell if so i apologize in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

1 | just a suggestion take a motorola mc14536b set it up to give you a pulse once every sec or ten secs with either a rc or xtal clock input then feed to a mc14521b as clock input and decode output for 1 209 600 sec output might have to add a few and gates or decoder chips to get output and reset pulse back to the 521 to restart cycle trigger a oneshot from the decoded riseing edge the one shot then goes to a mosfet to drive the mechanism to fire the pellet launcher these ckts require uamps of current between 5 15 volts so a 12 volt gel cell of a few amphours would last the six weeks then take the ckt board battery wrap in 3 or 4 of foam or build a box of out of the stuff with plywood or metal exterior build a small heater out of 10 50 watt resistors in series to keep the battery and ckts warm 2nd thought use 2 batteries one for heater one for timer and pellet trigger insolate insolate even though the chips state that the al rated devices are good to 55 c the batteries have a considerable reduction in capacity oh make sure the area inside has minium air leakage hope this helps rw is this to long winded for the net be gentle

1 | i had a ge emerson 13 color tv for about 3 years and one fine day while we were watching something i doubt if the program was the cause we heard a mild explosion our screen went blank but there was sound so we thought oh we have special effects on the program but soon the sound stopped and smoke started to appear at the back of the tv the brilliant ees we are we unplugged the tv and called customer service only to be thrown around by please hold i will transfer u to blah blah finally we abandoned the idea of trying to fix the tv and got a new one we wanted a bigger one too after all the story what i wanted to know is is my problem an isolated incident or a common one i recall reading about russian tvs exploding but not here in the us why would the picture tube explode or even smoke i still have the left over tv set i might dig into it this summer any idea where i can get parts for these things probably will cost more than tv
3 | actually the reboost will probably be done last so that there is a fuel reserve during the evas in case they have to chase down an adrift astronaut or something like that but yes you ve got the idea the reboost is done by taking the whole shuttle up somebody has to build that thruster module it s not an off the shelf item nor is it a trivial piece of hardware since it has to include attitude control hst s own is not strong enough to compensate for things like thruster imbalance guidance there is no provision to feed gyro data from hst s own gyros to an external device and separation you don t want it left attached afterward if only to avoid possible contamination after the telescope lid is opened again you also get to worry about whether the lid is going to open after the reboost is done and hst is inaccessible to the shuttle the lid stays closed for the duration of all of this to prevent mirror contamination from thrusters and the like the original plan was to use the orbital maneuvering vehicle to do the reboost the omv was planned to be a sort of small space tug well suited to precisely this sort of job unfortunately it was costing a lot to develop and the list of definitely known applications was relatively short so it got cancelled
1 | might be a good idea the resolution you requested is about 0 3mv in order to get what you ve paid for noise level better be lower than that it is kind of hard to do it in a noisy box like you can expect inside a pc before you pay for a pc card test it out by sampling a low distortion sine wave i think there is a sine wave on a cd digital domain there are possibly other low thd sources run the digitized waveform through a fft transform and take alook at the noise floor on the spectrum that s should give you a good indication of the design that s what i am doing to test a data acquistion system i have designed i got the idea from maxim data sheet if you can live with 14 bit resolution i would recommend looking at the max121 from maxim it is a high speed 308khz complete sampling a d with dsp interface the input range is 5v and it uses a serial interface which can easily be optically isolated from the computer to elinimate a major noise source the analog design guide i got from them shows a 100db noise level they claim a 77db max 85 typ thd looks pretty good for the 12 1000 pieces a evaluation kit is available might want to give these nice folks a call 1 800 998 8800 or fax 408 737 7194 and 408 737 7600 ext4000 for application assistance this assumes that you can build your own das and write your own software hey you can get the max121 as a free sample just by calling the 1 800 i would recommend you to find out the resolution that can be gotten out of your system by looking at the noise level otherwise you might be throwing out your money k c lee elec eng grad student

2 | fyi i just posted this on alt psychoactives as a response to what the group is for a note to the users of alt psychoactives this group was originally a takeoff from sci med the reason for the formation of this group was to discuss prescription psychoactive drugs such as antidepressents tri cyclics prozac lithium etc antipsychotics melleral sp etc ocd drugs anafranil etc and so on and so forth it didn t take long for this group to degenerate into a psudo alt drugs atmosphere that s to bad for most of the serious folks that wanted to start this group in the first place have left and gone back to sci med where you have to cypher through hundreds of unrelated articles to find psychoactive data it was also to discuss real life experiences and side effects of the above mentioned oh well i had unsubscribed to this group for some time and i decided to check it today to see if anything had changed nope same old nine or ten crap articles that this group was never intended for i think it is very hard to have a meaningfull group without it being moderated too bad oh well obviously no one really cares bill claussen would anyone be interested in starting a similar moderated group
3 | the commercial uses of a transportation system between already settled and civilized areas are obvious spaceflight is not in this position the correct analogy is not with aviation of the 30 s but the long transocean voyages of the age of discovery it didn t require gov t to fund these as long as something was known about the potential for profit at the destination in practice some were gov t funded some were private but there was no way that any wise investor would spend a large amount of money on a very risky investment with no idea of the possible payoff i am sure that a thriving spaceflight industry will eventually develop and large numbers of people will live and work off earth but if you ask me for specific justifications other than the increased resource base i can t give them we just don t know enough the launch rate demanded by existing space industries is just too low to bring costs down much and we are very much in the dark about what the revolutionary new space industries will be when they will practical how much will have to be invested to start them etc

1 | here s one i hope some knowledgeable readers will make a comment or contribution to in the state of virginia radar detectors are illegal period if you are caught with one it will be confiscated on the spot and will not be returned until after you appear in court and pay your fine the fine for having a radar detector accessible in a motor vehicle even if it is not on is 250 00 sorry tourist ignorance of the law is no excuse they will get you too it used to be that the only way the law could be enforced was for an officer to actually see the radar detector not any more many law enforcement agencies are now using radar detector detectors right a super sensitive receiver that is capable of picking up rf from the radar detector itself my first reaction was no way but guess again these little buggers really work and the police are writing citations right and left for people using radar detectors one news story quoted an officer as saying that he had found the radar detector in all of the cars he stopped except one and he could never figure out where it was but he knew it was there this tends to make one assume there are few false arrest now before i get flamed please understand that i do drive at or near the speed limit i do not need a radar detector to keep me from getting a speeding ticket but i do like to know when my speed is being clocked or a speed trap is functioning my radar detector now stays locked in my trunk when i am in virginia which is what they want and yes what the law says and i intend to obey the law and is only used in states where it is legal for my fellow hams i am not a microwave person my mind only works in the hf spectrum between 10 and 80 meters microwave enlightment may be necessary so the questions are what do the radar detector detectors actually detect would additional shielding grounding bypassing shield stray rf generated by a radar detector or is the rf actually being emitted by the detector antenna are any brands quieter than others

1 | actually the reasons you don t see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are 1 fossil units multiple units per plant are generally smaller than nuclear plants 300 mwe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built the average nuclear plant is 1000 mwe 2 many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted why those old dirt burners can t harm anything let em go 3 powered draft cooling towers low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off site are quite popular with fossil plants 4 fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size the issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine the condenser pressure is normally water s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature it is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best a related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes since the condenser is at a very low pressure the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity if the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate this is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps how much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell typically hotwell temperatures run between 100 and 120 degrees depending on the temperature of the river water this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped when the river water temperature is high in the summer operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head there is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers the temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding 70 degrees a vast difference from the typical 95 95 days 95 degrees 95 humidity we see routinely in the east it is not unusual particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure true actually secondary plant the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water by impure i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and or a few ppm of dissolved oxygen secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory john

2 | to construct a kirlian device find a copy of _handbook of psychic discoveries_ by sheila ostrander and lynn schroeder 1975 library of congress 73 88532 it describes the necessary equipment and suppliers for the tesla coil or alternatives the copper plate and setup i used a pack of sx 70 film and removed a single pack in a dark room then made the exposure put it back in the film pack and ran it out through the rollers of the camera forinstant developing and very high quality it is a good way to experience what kirlian photography is really and what it is not as you know all ready it is the pattern in the bioplasmic energy fieldthat is significant variations caused by exposure time distance from the plate or pressure on the plate or variations in the photo materials are not important

1 | while driving through the middle of nowhere i picked up knbr am 1070 a clear channel station based in los angeles they had an ad claiming that they were able to get traffic flow information from all of the thousands of traffic sensors that caltrans has placed under the pavement does caltrans sell this info does knbr have an exclusive what s the deal doug former l a commuter claar you were right the second time it is knx believe it or not i also listen to knx in the evenings here in colorado it s kind of fun driving through the country listening to traffic jams on the 405 back to your original question yes there are sensors just past every on ramp and off ramp on the freeways they re the same sensors used at most stoplights now coils in the pavement you might want to give caltrans a call or even ask bill keene knx s traffic reporter i doubt if just anyone can get the information but it would be worth asking just in case you can get it
1 | that depends entirely upon the advertiser whose number you circled radio electronics compiles all of the cards then each advertiser gets a computer printout of the names and addresses of all of the readers who circled their number some magazines also provide the data on self adhesive labels and the really big magazines provide the data on computer disk the advertiser decides what to do with the data they get you will notice that the radio electronics information card commonly called a bingo card in the industry includes lines for a company name and a business phone number my guess would be that the big national advertisers make a distinction between hobbiests and professionals as best they can for example if you include motorola as your company and include a business phone and a mail stop tektronics will probably send you a copy of their hard bound catalog and have a sales engineer call you about a week later if you leave it blank odds are they will send you a slick brochure and direct you to a local retail outlet medium and small companies are more likely to send you th e whole catalog and then some companies like digikey or jameco have nothing to mail out accept the catalog a couple of other interesting points about bingo cards free industry magazines like edn and such also log your card to their computer they use the information at least three ways they note that you really do read the magazine and are more likely to continue your subscription or push you through repeated mailings to re subscribe they also compile how many people requested which data for their marketing demographics this way thay can tell a prospective advertiser that 23 of readers requesting data were interested in capacitors and finally some magazines rent lists of readers who request certain information for example tektronics can rent a list of everyone who requested information about test equipment other than tektronic s in the past 6 months the other point in the data the advertiser receives many magazines include how many items you circled on the card if they want the advertiser can attempt to cull out the literature collectors from the serious potential customers can you say qualified sales leads i thought you could what s the best way for a hobbiest to deal with bingo cards never circle more than 8 number on the card if you want more than 8 items use the second card and mail it a couple of weeks later if you are really really serious and you really really want the information call the advertiser and ask this will also cut about 15 days off the the response time virtually everyone takes a voice on the phone more seriously than data on a computer printout to help insure you keep getting a trade magazine that you re not really qualified for send in a bingo card at least every other month and circle two or three numbers include a business name and phone number even if it s your house advertisers almost never call

2 | no one else seems to know so i ll post this this topic came up on sci physics fusion shortly after the cold fusion flap started as i recall its been done to some experimental mice they showed various ill effects and eventually died the reason is that deuterium does not have exactly the same reaction rates as hydrogen due to its extra mass which causes lower velocity boltzman constant mumble this throws various bits of body biochemistry out of kilter and you get sick and die i ve never heard of anyone being poisened this way in or out of real life the process takes quite a while if anyone wants to write this book i would imagine you would have to 1 replace a significant fraction of the water in the body with heavy water 2 wait while normal breakdown and repair processes cause other molecules in the body to be synthesised using the deuterium during this process the victim would gradually deteriorate and eventually die but i imagine it would take weeks during which the poisoner would have to ensure that a significant proportion of the water the victim ingested was heavy you would get such a mess of symptoms that the doctors would be both alarmed and confused why should every organ in the body suddenly begin to deteriorate if you can figure out how the poisoner gets the heavy water into the victim in a hospital then you could have a real story here come to think of it 2 would continue even after the heavy water was no longer being ingested so hospitalisation might be too late the most detectable effect would be that the victim s body fluids would literally be heavy water has a molecular weight of 18 and heavy water has a mw of 20 thus the victim s weight will increase by about 1 for every 10 of body water replaced by heavy water maybe the detection occurs because some pathologist in the lab notices that the victim s urine is strangely dense is there any medical test involving the specific gravity of a body fluid paul

3 | the sightings were apparently spurious there is no planet inside of the orbit of mercury the idea of vulcan came from the differences between mercury s observed perihelion precession and the value it should have had according to newtonian physics leverrier made an extensive set of observations and calculations during the mid 19th century and simon newcombe later improved on the observations and re calculated using leverrier s system of equations now leverrier was one of the co discoverers of neptune and since he had predicted its existence based on anomalies in the orbit of uranus his inclination was to believe the same sort of thing was afoot with mercury but alas twere not so mercury s perihelion precesses at the rate it does because the space where it resides near the sun is significantly curved due to the sun s mass this explanation had to wait until 1915 and albert einstein s synthesis of his earlier theory of the electrodynamics of moving bodies commonly called special relativity with reimanian geometry the result was the general theory of relativity and one of it s most noteworthy strengths is that it accounts for the precession of mercury s perihelion almost exactly exactly if you use newcomb s numbers rather than leverrier s of course not everybody believes einstein and that s fine but subsequent efforts to find any planets closer to the sun than mercury using radar have been fruitless bill gawne forgive him he is a barbarian who thinks the customs of his tribe are the laws of the universe g j caesar

2 | be sure to say chronic dizziness not just dizziness most patients with acute or subacute dizziness will get better the vertiginous spells of meniere s will also eventually go away however the patient is left with a deaf ear this may have helped you but i m not sure it is good general advice the odds that you are going to find some miracle with your own research that is secret or hidden from general knowledge for this or any other disease are slim when good answers to these problems are found it is usually in all the newspapers until then spending a great deal of time and energy on the medical problem may divert that energy from more productive things in life a limited amount should be spent to assure yourself that your doctor gave you the correct story but after it becomes clear that you are dealing with a problem for which medicine has no good solution perhaps the best strategy is to join the support group and keep abreast of new findings but not to make a career out of it gordon banks n3jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb cadre dsl pitt edu it is shameful to surrender it too soon

3 | the difficulties of a high isp otv include long transfer times radiation damage from vanallen belts for both the spacecraft and otv arcjets or xenon thrusters require huge amounts of power so you have to have either nuclear power source messy dangerous and source of radiation damage or big solar arrays sensitive to radiation or heavy that make attitude control and docking a big pain if you go solar you have to replace the arrays every trip with current technology nuclear power sources are strongly restricted by international treaty refueling even for very high isp like xenon is still required and turn out to be a pain you either have to develop autonomous rendezvous or long range teleoperation to do docking or and refueling you still can t do much plane change because the deltav required is so high the air force continues to look at doing things this way though i suppose they are biding their time till the technology becomes available and the problems get solved not impossible in principle but hard to do and marginally cheaper than one shot rockets at least today just a few random thoughts on high isp otv s i designed one once
1 | i recently bought an apparantly complete expansion chassis by mountain computer inc it consists of a box with 8 apple compatible slots powersupply brick interface card and ribbon cable to attach it to the computer to be expanded there was also included a small card with empty sockets on top and pins on the bottom that looks like it would plug into the motherboard somewhere after pulling a chip there s an empty socket also on the interface card and a short 16 pin dip jumper like the ones used with language cards this technological marvel came with no docs and i haven t a clue as how to hook this thing up if anyone has docs and or users disk of any sort for this i could really use copies of them or at least some help i need to know o how to orient the ribbon cable between the card and the chassis o how to attach the short cable from the motherboard to the card and if the small card is used o the purposes of the various jumper pins on the card it has more of those than my cms scsi card

3 | hmmmm the prefix peri is greek not latin so it s usually used with the greek form of the name of the body being orbited that s why it s perihelion rather than perisol perigee rather than periterr and pericynthion rather than perilune so for jupiter i d expect it to be something like perizeon
3 | larsonian astronomy and physics orthodox physicists astronomers and astrophysicists claim to be looking for a unified field theory in which all of the forces of the universe can be explained with a single set of laws or equations but they have been systematically ignoring or suppressing an excellent one for 30 years the late physicist dewey b larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe which he calls the reciprocal system is built on two fundamental postulates about the physical and mathematical natures of space and time 1 the physical universe is composed entirely of one component motion existing in three dimensions in discrete units and in two reciprocal forms space and time 2 the physical universe conforms to the relations of ordinary commutative mathematics its magnitudes are absolute and its geometry is euclidean from these two postulates larson developed a complete theoretical universe using various combinations of translational vibrational rotational and vibrational rotational motions the concepts of in ward and out ward scalar motions and speeds in relation to the speed of light which larson called unit velocity and the natural datum at each step in the development larson was able to match objects in his theoretical universe with objects in the real physical universe photons sub atomic particles incomplete atoms charges atoms molecules globular star clusters galaxies binary star systems solar systems white dwarf stars pulsars quasars etc even objects not yet discovered then such as exploding galaxies and gamma ray bursts and applying his theory to his new model of the atom larson was able to precisely and accurately calculate inter atomic distances in crystals and molecules compressibility and thermal expansion of solids and other properties of matter all of this is described in good detail with out fancy complex mathematics in his books books of dewey b larson the following is a complete list of the late physicist dewey b larson s books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe some of the early books are out of print now but still available through inter library loan the

for the 8 3 billion super collider the last four chapters explain chemical bonding the neglected facts of science 1982 the universe of motion 1984 final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries basic properties of matter 1988 all but the last of these books were published by north pacific publishers p o box 13255 portland or 97213 and should be available via inter library loan if your local university or public library doesn t have each of them several of them including the last one are available from the international society of unified science isus 1680 e atkin ave salt lake city utah 84106 this is the organization that was started to promote larson s theory they have other related publications including the quarterly journal reciprocity physicist dewey b larson s background physicist dewey b larson was a retired engineer chemical or electrical he was about 91 years old when he died in may 1989 he had a bachelor of science degree in engineering science from oregon state university he developed his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe while trying to develop a way to compute chemical properties based only on the elements used larson s lack of a fancy ph d degree might be one reason that orthodox physicists are ignoring him but it is not a valid reason sometimes it takes a relative outsider to clearly see the forest through the trees at the same time it is clear from his books that he also knew orthodox physics and astronomy as well as any physicist or astronomer well enough to point out all their contradictions ad hoc assumptions principles of impotence in consistencies etc larson did not have the funds etc to experimentally test his theory and it was not necessary for him to do so he simply compared the various parts of his theory with other researchers experimental and observational data and in many cases his explanation fit better a self consistent theory is much more than the orthodox physicists and astronomers have they claim to be looking for a unified field theory that works but have been ignoring one for over 30 years now modern physics does not explain the physical universe so well some parts of some of larson s books are full of quotations of leading orthodox physicists and astronomers who agree and remember that epicycles crystal spheres geocentricity flat earth theory etc also once seemed to explain it well but were later proved conceptually wrong prof frank h meyer professor emeritus of uw superior was is a strong proponent of larson s theory and was or still is president of larson s organization the international society of unified science and editor of their quarterly journal reciprocity he moved to minneapolis after retiring super collider boondoggle i am against contruction of the superconducting super collider in texas or anywhere else it would be a gross waste of money and contribute almost nothing of scientific value most physicists don t realize it but according to the comprehensive general unified theory of the late physicist dewey b larson as described in his books the strange goofy particles mesons hyperons alleged quarks etc which they are finding in existing colliders fermi lab cern etc are really just atoms of anti matter which are created by the high energy colliding beams and which quickly disintegrate like cosmic rays because they are incompatible with their environment a larger and more expensive collider will only create a few more elements of anti matter that the physicists have not seen there before and the physicists will be even more confused than they are now are a few more types of anti matter atoms worth the 8 3 billion cost don t we have much more important uses for this wasted money another thing to consider is that the primary proposed location in texas has a serious and growing problem with some kind of fire ants eating the insulation off underground cables how much poisoning of the ground and ground water with insecticides will be required to keep the ants out of the supercollider naming the super collider after ronald reagon as proposed is totally absurd if it is built it should be named after a leading particle physicist larsonian anti matter in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe anti matter is not a simple case of opposite charges of the same types of particles it has more to do with the rates of vibrations and rotations of the photons of which they are made in relation to the vibrational and rotational equivalents of the speed of light which larson calls unit velocity and the natural datum in larson s theory a positron is actually a particle of matter not anti matter when a positron and electron meet the rotational vibrations charges and rotations of their respective photons of which they are made neutralize each other in larson s theory the anti matter half of the physical universe has three dimensions of time and only one dimension of space and exists in a reciprocal relationship to our material half larsonian relativity the perihelion point in the orbit of the planet mercury has been observed and precisely measured to advance at the rate of 574 seconds of arc per century 531 seconds of this advance are attributed via calculations to gravitational perturbations from the other planets venus earth jupiter etc the remaining 43 seconds of arc are being used to help prove einstein s general theory of relativity but the late physicist dewey b larson achieved results closer to the 43 seconds than general relativity can by instead using special relativity in one or more of his books he applied the lorentz transformation on the high orbital speed of mercury larson totally rejected general relativity as another mathematical fantasy he also rejected most of special relativity including the parts about mass increases near the speed of light and the use of the lorentz transform on doppler shifts those quasars with red shifts greater than 1 000 really are moving faster than the speed of light although most of that motion is away from us in time in larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe there are three dimensions of time instead of only one but two of those dimensions can not be measured from our material half of the physical universe the one dimension that we can measure is the clock time at low relative speeds the values of the other two dimensions are negligible but at high speeds they become significant and the lorentz transformation must be used as a fudge factor larson often used the term coordinate time when writing about this in regard to mass increases it has been proven in atomic accelerators that acceleration drops toward zero near the speed of light but the formula for acceleration is acceleration force mass a f m orthodox physicists are ignoring the third factor force in larson s theory mass stays constant and force drops toward zero force is actually a motion or combinations of motions or relations between motions including inward and outward scalar motions the expansion of the universe for example is an outward scalar motion inherent in the universe and not a result of the so called big bang which is yet another mathematical fantasy the universe of motion i wish to recommend to everyone the book the universe of motion by dewey b larson 1984 north pacific publishers p o box 13255 portland oregon 97213 456 pages indexed hardcover it contains the astrophysical portions of a general unified theory of the physical universe developed by that author an unrecognized genius more than thirty years ago it contains final solutions to most all astrophysical mysteries including the formation of galaxies binary and multiple star systems and solar systems the true origin of the 3 degree background radiation cosmic rays and gamma ray bursts and the true nature of quasars pulsars white dwarfs exploding galaxies etc it contains what astronomers and astrophysicists are all looking for if they are ready to seriously consider it with open minds the following is an example of his theory s success in his first book in 1959 the structure of the physical universe larson predicted the existence of exploding galaxies several years before astronomers started finding them they are a necessary consequence of larson s comprehensive theory and when quasars were discovered he had an immediate related explanation for them also gamma ray bursts astro physicists and astronomers are still scratching their heads about the mysterious gamma ray bursts they were originally thought to originate from neutron stars in the disc of our galaxy but the new gamma ray telescope now in earth orbit has been detecting them in all directions uniformly and their source locations in space do not correspond to any known objects except for a few cases of directional coincidence gamma ray bursts are a necessary consequence of the general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson according to page 386 of his book the universe of motion published in 1984 the gamma ray bursts are coming from supernova explosions in the anti matter half of the physical universe which larson calls the cosmic sector because of the relationship between the anti matter and material halves of the physical universe and the way they are connected together the gamma ray bursts can pop into our material half anywhere in space seemingly at random this is why the source locations of the bursts do not correspond with known objects and come from all directions uniformly i wonder how close to us in space a source location would have to be for a gamma ray burst to kill all or most life on earth there would be no way to predict one nor to stop it perhaps some of the mass extinctions of the past which are now being blamed on impacts of comets and asteroids were actually caused by nearby gamma ray bursts larsonian binary star formation about half of all the stars in the galaxy in the vicinity of the sun are binary or double but orthodox astronomers and astrophysicists still have no satisfactory theory about how they form or why there are so many of them but binary star systems are actually a likely consequence of the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson i will try to summarize larsons explanation which is detailed in chapter 7 of his book the universe of motion and in some of his other books first of all according to larson stars do not generate energy by fusion a small fraction comes from slow gravitational collapse the rest results from the complete annihilation of heavy elements heavier than iron each element has a destructive temperature limit the heavier the element is the lower is this limit a star s internal temperature increases as it grows in mass via accretion and absorption of the decay products of cosmic rays gradually reaching the destructive temperature limit of lighter and lighter elements when the internal temperature of the star reaches the destructive temperature limit of iron there is a type i supernova explosion this is because there is so much iron present and that is related to the structure of iron atoms and the atom building process which larson explains in some of his books better than i can when the star explodes the lighter material on the outer portion of the star is blown outward in space at less than the speed of light the heavier material in the center portion of the star was already bouncing around at close to the speed of light because of the high temperature the explosion pushes that material over the speed of light and it expands outward in time which is equivalent to inward in space and it often actually disappears for a while over long periods of time both masses start to fall back gravitationally the material that had been blown outward in space now starts to form a red giant star the material that had been blown outward in time starts to form a white dwarf star both stars then start moving back toward the main sequence from opposite directions on the h r diagram the chances of the two masses falling back into the exact same location in space making a single lone star again are near zero they will instead form a binary system orbiting each other according to larson a white dwarf star has an inverse density gradient is densest at its surface because the material at its center is most widely dispersed blown outward in time this eliminates the need to resort to mathematical fantasies about degenerate matter neutron stars black holes etc larsonian solar system formation if the mass of the heavy material at the center of the exploding star is relatively small then instead of a single white dwarf star there will be several mini white dwarf stars revolving around the red giant star but probably still too far away in three dimensional time to be affected by its heat etc these will become planets in chapter 7 of the universe of motion larson used all this information and other principles of his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe to derive his own version of bode s law black hole fantasy i heard that physicist stephen w hawking recently completed a theoretical mathematical analysis of two black holes merging together into a single black hole and concluded that the new black hole would have more mass than the sum of the two original black holes such a result should be recognized by everyone as a red flag causing widespread doubt about the whole idea of black holes etc after reading physicist dewey b larson s books about his comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe especially his book the universe of motion it is clear to me that black holes are nothing more than mathematical fantasies the strange object at cygnus x 1 is just an unusually massive white dwarf star not the black hole that orthodox astronomers and physicists so badly want to prove their theory by the way i do not understand why so much publicity is being given to physicist stephen hawking the physicists and astronomers seem to be acting as if hawking s severe physical problem somehow makes him wiser it does not i wish the same attention had been given to physicist dewey b larson while he was still alive widespread publicity and attention should now be given to larson s theory books and organization the international society of unified science electro magnetic propulsion i heard of that concept many years ago in connection with ufo s and unorthodox inventors but i never was able to find out how or why they work or how they are constructed i found a possible clue about why they might work on pages 112 113 of the book basic properties of matter by the late physicist dewey b larson which describes part of larson s comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe i quote one paragraph as indicated in the preceding chapter the development of the theory of the universe of motion arrives at a totally different concept of the nature of electrical resistance the electrons we find are derived from the environment it was brought out in volume i larson s book nothing but motion that there are physical processes in operation which produce electrons in substantial quantities and that although the motions that constitute these electrons are in many cases absorbed by atomic structures the opportunities for utilizing this type of motion in such structures are limited it follows that there is always a large excess of free electrons in the material sector material half of the universe most of which are uncharged in this uncharged state the electrons cannot move with respect to extension space because they are inherently rotating units of space and the relation of space to space is not motion in open space therefore each uncharged electron remains permanently in the same location with respect to the natural reference system in the manner of a photon in the context of the stationary spatial reference system the uncharged electron like the photon is carried outward at the speed of light by the progression of the natural reference system all material aggregates are thus exposed to a flux of electrons similar to the continual bombardment by photons of radiation meanwhile there are other processes to be discussed later whereby electrons are returned to the environment the electron population of a material aggregate such as the earth therefore stabilizes at an equilibrium level note that in larson s theory uncharged electrons are also massless and are basically photons of light of a particular frequency above the unit frequency spinning around one axis at a particular rate below the unit rate unit velocity is the speed of light and there are vibrational and rotational equivalents to the speed of light according to larson s theory i might have the above and below labels mixed up larson is saying that outer space is filled with mass less un charged electrons flying around at the speed of light if this is true then the electro magnetic propulsion fields of spacecraft might be able to interact with these electrons or other particles in space perhaps giving them a charge and mass and shooting them toward the rear to achieve propulsion in larson s theory an electrical charge is a one dimensional rotational vibration of a particular frequency above the unit frequency superimposed on the rotation of the particle the paragraph quoted above might also give a clue to confused meteorologists about how and why lightning is generated in clouds suppression of larsonian physics the comprehensive general unified theory of the physical universe developed by the late physicist dewey b larson has been available for more than 30 years published in 1959 in his first book the structure of the physical universe it is totally un scientific for hawking wheeler sagan and the other sacred priests of the religion they call science or physics or astronomy etc as well as the scientific literature and the education systems to totally ignore larson s theory has they have larson s theory has excellent explanations for many things now puzzling orthodox physicists and astronomers such as gamma ray bursts and the nature of quasars larson s theory deserves to be honestly and openly discussed in the physics chemistry and astronomy journals in the u s and elsewhere and at least the basic principles of larson s theory should be included in all related courses at uw ec uw madison cambridge cornell university and elsewhere so that students are not kept in the dark about a worthy alternative to the dogma they are being fed for more information answers to your questions etc please consult my cited sources especially larson s books un altered reproduction and dissemination of this important partial summary is encouraged
1 | write a good manual to go with the software the hassle of photocopying the manual is offset by simplicity of purchasing the package for only 15 also consider offering an inexpensive but attractive perc for registered users for instance a coffee mug you could produce and mail the incentive for a couple of dollars so consider pricing the product at 17 95 you re lucky if only 20 of the instances of your program in use are non licensed users the best approach is to estimate your loss and accomodate that into your price structure sure it hurts legitimate users but too bad retailers have to charge off loss to shoplifters onto paying customers the software industry is the same unless your product is exceptionally unique using an ostensibly copy proof disk will just send your customers to the competetion
1 | heh heh heh heh i laugh because i have the same damn tv and it did the same thing actually it is a goldstar but it s essentially the same tv and electronics just a different face plate and name 1 fortunately tv tubes don t explode i d think the tv mfrs want to make this possibility remote as possible if at all they ll implode and the glass that blows out would be the result of the glass boucing off the back of the tube due to the implosion in any case don t kick it around 2 i fixed the tv after getting a hold of some schematics it turned out to be a blown 2w resistor feeding the flyback transformer i guess the original resistor was a bit too small to dissipate the heat it created burning itself out i checked to make sure the flyback wasn t shorted or anything first oh luckily i had a resistor handy lying around that had just the right value for what i needed i can t see it being more than 50 cents
3 | any lunar satellite needs fuel to do regular orbit corrections and when its fuel runs out it will crash within months the orbits of the apollo motherships changed noticeably during lunar missions lasting only a few days it is possible that there are stable orbits here and there the moon s gravitational field is poorly mapped but we know of none perturbations from sun and earth are relatively minor issues at low altitudes the big problem is that the moon s own gravitational field is quite lumpy due to the irregular distribution of mass within the moon
2 | and to add further fuel to the flame war i read about 20 years ago that the natural msg extracted from the sources you mention above does not cause the reported aftereffects it s only that nasty artificial msg extracted from coal tar or whatever that causes chinese restaurant syndrome i find this pretty hard to believe has anyone else heard it
3 | that would not explain why widely separated detectors such as on ulysses and pvo and ginga et al would see a burst at the same time in fact be fore batse having this widely separated interplanetary network was the only sure way to locate a random burst with only one detector one cannot locate a burst except to say it s somewhere in the field of view with two detectors one can use the time that the burst is seen in each detector to narrow the location to a thin annulus on the sky with three detectors one gets intersecting annuli giving two possible locations if one of these locations is impossible because say the earth blocked that part of the sky voila you have an error box batse by having 8 detectors of its own can do its own location determination but only to within about 3 degrees would someone at gsfc like david like to comment on the current state of location determination having inde pendent sightings by other detectors helps drive down the uncertainty you did touch on something that you didn t mean to though some believe in a reference that i have somewhere that absorption like features seen in a fraction of grbs can actually be caused by the detector it would be a mean nasty god though that would have a nai crystal act like a 10 12 gauss neutron star but this is getting too far afield
2 | i noticed several years ago that when i took analgesics fairly regularly motrin at the time i seemed to get a lot of migraines but had forgotten about that until i started reading some of the posts here i generally don t take nsaids or tylenol for headaches because i ve found them to be ineffective however i have two other pain sources that force me to take nsaids currently naprosyn first is some pelvic pain that i get at the beginning of my period and then much worse at midcycle i have had surgery for endometriosis in the past 12 years ago so the drs tell me that my pain is probably due to the endometriosis coming back i ve tried synarel it reduced the pain while i took it 3 mos but the pain returned immediately after i stopped three doctors have suggested hysterectomy as the only real solution to my problem although i don t expect to have any more children i don t like the idea of having my uterus and one remaining ovary removed the first ovary was removed when i had the surgery for endometriosis one of the drs that suggested i get a hysterectomy is an expert in laser surgery but perhaps thinks that type of procedure is only worthwhile on women who still plan to have children so basically all i m left with is toughing out the pain this would be impossible without naprosyn or something similar but not aspirin that doesn t work and motrin gave me horrible gastritis a few years ago so i m through with it in fact naprosyn works very well at eliminating the pain if i take it regularly as i did when i had severe back pain and pain in both legs as i ll discuss in a moment generally though i wait until i have the pain before i take the naprosyn but then it takes several hours for it reduce the pain it s actually quite effective at reducing the pain it just takes quite a while in the meantime i m frequently in severe pain the other pain source i have is chronic lower back pain resulting in bilateral radiculopathy i ve had mris xrays ct scan and emgs i ve had 2 of them and don t intend to ever do that again with nerve conduction tests the tests have not been conclusive as to what is causing my back and leg pain the mri reports both say i have several bulging degeneratig disks and from the xrays and mri i think it is apparent that i have arthritis the reading on the ct scan was that there are two herniations l3 l4 and l4 l5 but others hav looked at the films and concluded that there are no herniations the second emg and nerve conduction studies shows significant denervation compared to the first emg oh yeah i had some other horrible test called something like somatic evoked response which showed that the internal nerves are working fine anyway the bottom line is that i sometimes have severe pain in both legs and back pain the back pain is there all the time but i can live with it when the leg pain is there i need some analgesic anti inflammatory medication to reduce the pain to a level where i can work so i took naprosyn regulary for 6 9 months every time i tried to stop the leg pain got worse so i d always resume since last november i have taken it much less frequently and primarily for the pelvic pain i have been going to physical therapy for the last 8 months 2 3 times a week after the first month or so my therapist put me on pelvic traction she had tried it earlier but it had caused a lot of pain in my back this time she tried it at a lower weight after a month or two the pain in my legs began going away but the traction aways caused discomfort in my lower back which could be reduced with ultrasound and massage so now i don t have nearly as much pain in my legs in fact my therapist took me off traction about 2 weeks ago getting back to my original reason for this post even if i can avoid taking analgesic for headaches i really can t avoid them entirely because i have other pain sources that force me to use them oh i forgot to mention that it has been suggested to me that i have back surgery but i m avoiding that too i find the migraines difficult to deal with occassionally i have to take off work but usually i can work but at a reduced capacity i m a systems engineer and do a lot of reading and writing when the pelvic pain is bad i can t concentrate much i usually end up jumping out of my chair every few minutes because the pain is so bothersome when the pain in my back is bad it can cause severe burning in both legs shooting pains in my legs electric shock type of pain in my feet and toes and basically when it gets bad i can t really sit at all then i end up spending most of my time home and in bed so even if the analgesics contribute to the migraines the migraines are more tolerable than the other pain sources i get a lot of migraines an average of 3 to 4 a month which last 1 3 days i ve taken cafergot the first time the caffiene really got to me so i reduced the dosage but i don t like the side effects if i take more than two i get diahrea if i get a very bad headache i will eventually take the cafergot my neurologist wasn t very helpful when i told him my problems with cafergot he said that when sumatriptan becomes available i should try that i ve tried several other medications fiornal midrin fiornal with codeine tegretol and inderal but they either didn t work or i couldn t tolerate them so what can i do my doctor s seem to be satisfied with me just trying to tolerate the pain which i agree with most of the time but not when i have a lot of pain i ve had some bad experiences with surgery my heart stopped once from the anesthesia i was told that it was likely the succinylcholine and i ve already had surgery several times anyway the point of what i m saying is that even if analgesics can contribute to migraines some people need to take them to tolerate other pain

1 | lots more deleted i think the hangup with digital scopes is that you have to know so much more about them and how they work on a scope by scope basis and some of the functions are typically presented in my opinion in a counter intuitive fashion hp has made some strides in their 54600 series imo automatic setups are fine for simple repetitive waveforms but can give you some crazy results on more complex events where you need to understand how the scope is actually measuring processing the event for example is the scope in equivalent time or in real time sampling mode equivalent time being a mode where samples are built up slowly by adding a delay to the trigger event each sweep what was the scope s actual sampling rate at the time how is the data being massaged after capture but before display etc one common misconception is the speed of the scope is the hp scope you re using really a 100 mhz scope or is it a 20 mhz sample rate scope 5 mhz single shot significance whose front end including s h can support 100 mhz waveforms important for equivalent time sampling the 100 mhz input in this case really only helps you when your waveform is repetitive or on a single sample when you get lucky and hit a transient event during a sample time so there are a lot more variables in understanding how to get useful information from a digital scope i prefer an analog scope for general use and the digital for events where i need storage for later analysis or comparison when the event is within the capability of the scope now for the price of true 100 mhz digital scopes to fall dave medin phone 205 730 3169 w ssd networking 205 837 1174 h intergraph corp m s gd3004 internet dtmedin catbyte b30 ingr com huntsville al 35894 uucp uunet ingr b30 catbyte dtmedin everywhere you look at least around my office
1 | you can get a little uv by putting a heavy uv filter deep purple in front of an ordinary flashlight bulb the brightest you can get my father used a setup like this in law enforcement work circa 1964 good uv blacklight bulbs work like fluorescent bulbs i d proceed by getting a cheap battery powered _fluorescent_ light then going to an electrical supply house and finding a uv bulb that would fit it
3 | oddly enough the smithsonian calls the lindbergh years the golden age of flight i would call it the granite years reflecting the primitive nature of it it was romantic swashbuckling daredevils those daring young men in their flying machines but in reality it sucked death was a highly likely occurence and the environment blew ever see the early navy pressure suits they were modified diving suits you were ready to star in plan 9 from outer space radios and nav aids were a joke and engines ran on castor oil they picked and called aviators men with iron stomachs and it wasn t due to vertigo oddly enough now we are in the golden age of flight i can hop the shuttle to ny for 90 bucks now that s golden mercury gemini and apollo were romantic but let s be honest peeing in bags having plastic bags glued to your butt everytime you needed a bowel movement living for days inside a vw bug romantic but not commercial the dc x points out a most likely new golden age an age where fat cigar smoking business men in loud polyester space suits will fill the skys with strip malls and used space ship lots hhhmmmmm maybe i ll retract that golden age bit maybe it was better in the old days of course then we ll have wally schirra telling his great grand children in my day we walked on the moon every day miles no buses you kids got it soft

3 | the face is an accident of light and shadow there are many faces in landforms on earth none is artificial well excluding mount rushmore and the like there is also a smiley face on mars and a kermit the frog the question of life in a more mundane sense bacteria or the like is not quite closed although the odds are against it and the most that the more orthodox exobiologists are hoping for now is fossils there are currently no particular plans to do any further searches for life mars observer currently approaching mars will probably try to get a better image or two of the face at some point it s not high priority nobody takes it very seriously the shadowed half of the face does not look very face like so all it will take is one shot at a different sun angle to ruin the illusion
1 | do you know if there is an airport nearby they may just be markers to tell pilots of small planes that there are power lines nearby

3 | ocean reconnaissance launch surprises west space news april 5 11 1993 p 2 excerpts russia launched its first ocean reconnaissance satellite in 26 months march 30 confounding western analysts who had proclaimed the program dead the itar tass news agency announced the launch of cosmos 2238 from plesetsk cosmodrome but provided little description of the payload s mission however based on the satellite s trajectory western observers identified it as a military spacecraft designed to monitor electronic emissions from foreign naval ships in order to track their movement geoff perry of the kettering group in england said western observers had concluded that no more would be launched but days after the last such satellite re entered the earth s atmosphere cosmos 2238 was launched cosmos 2238 satellite launched for defense ministry moscow itar tass world service in russian 1238 gmt 30 march 1993 translated in fbis sov 93 060 p 27 by itar tass correspondent veronika romanenkova moscow 30 march the cosmos 2238 satellite was launched at 1600 moscow time today from the baykonur by a tsiklon m carrier rocket an itar tass correspondent was told at the press center of russia s space military forces that the satellite was launched in the interests of the russian defense ministry

1 | hi i was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related subjects i am currently learning about am fm receivers and recieving circuits p s any really good books on am fm theory along with detailed electrical diagrams would help a lot i have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of circuit books with no theory but one without the other does not help a pretty serious book that still seems readable is communication receivers principes and design by rohde and bucher
1 | try comp dcom i was reading a thread a while back about an 800 number that you could dial worked here it was a sales line for sprint i think telling you that you could have all your customers numbers using there ani then it told you your number should work with any modern switch mycal

1 | actually detecting a break is done by watching for a character containing all zero bits with the framing error resulting from its receipt this means that the line stayed in the zero bit state even past the stop bit time slot which basically indicates a break there is no special way to detect break that i have found other than this there s no magic signal generated by uarts etc
2 | i second what spenser aden said in reply additionally it is hard to say what type of response you ar3e having to prednisone since you did not say how long you have been on it patients are generally kept on steroids for months before thinking about tapering alternatives to daily dosing are every other day dosing in your case 20mg every other day would be a start another option if it is not possible to get you off prednisone is to start azathioprine like spenser said you should generally be on another drug in addition to your prednisone like asulfidine a lot of the specifics about options though depends on severity location and duration of disease as well as histology so take advice off the net for what it is worth i treat patients with uc and crohn s an educated patient is a good patient but let your doctor know where the advice came from so things can be put in context you should also be a member of the crohn s and colitis foundation of america 1 800 932 2423 office 1 800 343 3637 info hotline best of luck to you
2 | hi i need information on scaring particularly as a result of grazing the skin i really wanted to know of 1 would a scar occur as a result of grazing 2 if yes then would it disappear 3 how long does a graze take to heal 4 will hair grow on it once it has healed 5 what is scar tissue 6 should antiseptic cream be applied to it regularly 7 is it better to keep it exposed and let fresh air at it please help any info no matter how small will be appreciated greatly

2 | dn from nyeda cnsvax uwec edu david nye dn briefly this is a condition in which patients who have significant dn residual weakness from childhood polio notice progression of the dn weakness as they get older one theory is that the remaining motor dn neurons have to work harder and so die sooner if this theory were true the muscle biopsy would show group atrophy evidence of acute loss of enlarged motor units it doesn t instead the biopsy shows scattered angulated atrophic fibers this is more consistent with load shedding by chronically overworked motor neurons the neurons survive at the expense of increasingly denervated muscle
3 | i posted this over in sci astro but it didn t make it here thought you all would like my wonderful pithy commentary what you guys have never seen the goodyear blimp polluting the daytime and nightime skies actually an oribital sign would only be visible near sunset and sunrise i believe so pollution at night would be minimal if it pays for space travel go for it those who don t like spatial billboards can then head for the pristine environment of jupiter s moons
3 | actually the idea like most good ideas comes from jules verne not _the gods must be crazy _ in one of his lesser known books i can t remember which one right now the protagonists are in a balloon gondola travelling over africa on their way around the world in the balloon when one of them drops a fob watch they then speculate about the reaction of the natives to finding such a thing dropped straight down from heaven but the notion is not pursued further than that
1 | i ve got the same problem i can t dig up any info on the jumper settings on the hd 3 5 drives can anyone recommend a reference book s on the subject rather than a quick fix type answer i was going to start hooking up things and logging the results but the prospect of a ten second smoke test deters me thanks kirk cowen

3 | why use a ground launch pad it is entirely posible to launch from altitude this was what the shuttle was originally intended to do it might be seriously cheaper also what about bio engineered co2 absorbing plants instead of many lox bottles stick em in a lunar cave and put an airlock on the door
1 | try the folks at dimolex corp la crescenta ca 91214 their number is 818 957 7001 they make membrane keypads that are very flat in layouts from 2 to 128 keys they have standard models tactile models with stainless domes under each key to make a click you can feel as well as backlit models some of them can even be cut with scissors to form a funky shape other than a rectangle many of the models are available in a kit which includes a bezel colored and plain key covers and rub on lettering to make your own layout one piece prices aren t cheap though as they want 10 for one four position pad kit and 45 for a 40 position kit i have no affiliation with dimolex or any company connected with them i have purchased a couple of keypads from them and am pleased with what i got
2 | lots of editing out of previuos posts funny about that my wife my girlfriend at the time used to get sick after eating certain foods at various asian restaurants and never knew why she d go pale and sweaty and then vomit copiously a couple of us ventured a connection with msg and her response was msg what s that it also happened when she pigged out on some brands of savoury crackers and chips which i noticed later had msg on the label don t know about double blinds but avoiding msg has stopped her being sick at restaurants cheers john
1 | i too have a xc68882rc50 math coprocessor which i installed succesfully in my mega midget racer clocked at 33 mhz i have tried clocking my fpu at 28 to 50 mhz and it all worked just fine i have a mc68030 33 cpu i don t know why my fpu has an xc my original 33mhz fpu was label mc68882 33 but it seems to work fine on my system maybe you just have a bad chip stefan
3 | ssf is up for redesign again let s do it right this time let s step back and consider the functionality we want 1 microgravity vacuum process research 2 life sciences research adaptation to space 3 spacecraft maintenence the old nasa approach explified by shuttle and ssf so far was to centralize functionality these projects failed to meet their targets by a wide margin the military and commercial users took most of their payloads off shuttle after wasting much effort to tie their payloads to it and ssf has crumbled into disorganization and miscommunication over 50 billion has been spent on these two projects with no reduction in launch costs and littel improvement in commercial space industrialization meanwhile military and commercial users have come up with a superior strategy for space development the constellation firstly different functions are broken down into different constellations placed in the optimal orbit for each function thus we have the gps navstar constellation in 12 hour orbits comsats in clarke and molniya orbits etc secondly the task is distributed amongst several spacecraft in a constellation providing for redundancy and full coverage where needed ssf s 3 main functions require quite different environments and are also prime candidates for constellization 1 we have the makings of a microgravity constellation now comet and mir for long duration flights shuttle spacelab for short duration flights the best strategy for this area is inexpensive incremental improvement installation of u s facilities on mir shuttle mir linkup and transition from shuttle spacelab to a much less expensive ssto spacehab comet or ssto sif comet we might also expand the research program to take advantage of interesting space environments eg the high radiation van allen belt or gas plasma gradients in comet tails the comet system can be much more easily retrofitted for these tasks where a station is too large to affordably launch beyond leo 2 we need to study life sciences not just in microgravity but also in lunar and martian gravities and in the radiation environments of deep space instead of the protected shelter of leo this is a very long term low priority project since astronauts will have little practical use in the space program until costs come down orders of magnitude furthermore using astronauts severely restricts the scope of the investigation and the sample size so i propose labratsat a constellation tether bolo satellites that test out various levels of gravity in super van allen belt orbits that are representative of the radiation environment encountered on earth moon earth mars earth asteroid etc trips the miniaturized life support machinery might be operated real time from earth thru a vr interface after several orbital missions have been flown follow ons can act as ldefs on the lunar and martian surface testing out the actual environment at low cost before billions are spent on astronauts 3 by far the largest market for spacecraft servicing is in clarke orbit i propose a fleet of small teleoperated robots and small test satellites on which ground engineers can practice their skills once in place robots can pry stuck solar arrays and antennas attach solar battery power packs inject fuel etc once the fleet is working it can be spun off to commercial company s who can work with the comsat companies to develop comsat replaceable module standards by applying the successful constellation strategy and getting rid of the failed centralized strategy of sts and old ssf we have radically improved the capability of the program while greatly cutting its cost for a fraction of ssf s pricetag we can fix satellites where the satellites are we can study life s adaptation to a much large more representative variety of space environments and we can do microgravity and vacuum research inexpensively and if needed in special purpose orbits n b we can apply the constellation strategy to space exploration as well greatly cutting its cost and increasing its functionality mars network and artemis are two good examples of this more ambitiously we can set up a network of native propellant plants on mars that can be used to fuel planet wide rover ballistic hopper prospecting and sample return the descendants of labratsat s technology can be used as a mars surface ldef and to test out closed ecology greenhouses on mars at low cost

3 | i m not very impressed by the old so called prospecting work from lpi it has almost all been geared towards industrially silly processes on the moon as an excuse to put astronauts there translation it doesn t support the nick szabo vision of the future to which you must subscribe fred we re all supporting what each of us thinks should be done to some degree if you have a problem with what nick thinks should be done address it instead of just complaining about his doing so you really don t get what the complaints are about do you not incredibly clear explanation of complaints something between feelings regarding nick s method and judgments about his meaning t f fred s issue 1 nick s alleged trashing of others i only got it when you stopped trashing and made your point patently instead of allegorically that was my point all along fred i see we are dealing with a problem in a conflict of interpretations not least of which is your belief that only you can adequately judge what is and is not debate suffice to say that i disagree with you on that last point why don t you take a poll fred if you want some psuedo objective point of view and as usual you defend your insults with he started it yeah i took some of his research and called it my own but he started it so what if i stole his car he stole my lawnmower first besides that i think it s still open to interpretation whether nick actually did start it so your defense besides being lame and contradicting the first part of the sentence in which it occurs may not even apply anyway your defense reminds me of the guy that broke the borrowed tool i never borrowed it i already gave it back and it was broken when you gave it to me make up yer mind fred first i try to address what i think you meant for which i am rewarded with a denial of sorts and a smart remark then i point out that i am not clear what you did mean rather than risking your childish ire wrongly interpreting you a second time and i m stupid for it i just can t win can i fred you ve got a great point here somewhere it s just that between stupid people that you must insult and your jealous guarding of your valuable opinions you never actually get around to making it fred issue 2 nick s alleged meaning too bad the plan only exists in your mind instead of nick s or you would have a really good point instead you have provided a good reason to ignore your insults since they are based on incorrect interpretations that you have made about others forgive me for giving your insults more meaning than they ever should have had my reading of what nick actually said is that people aren t required in all parts of all space processes so your taking issue with his opinions regarding people in the space program i read as people are required in all parts of all space processes so help me out here fred since i m so patently stupid did you read nick wrong or are you going to eat your terminal now if the latter i sure hope it s one of those cheeto and string models that all the computer mags have been raving about the point is _i_ am not stupid because of _your_ incorrect assumption i d only be stupid if i insulted you for having made it but alas that s your job fred and finally your style is confusing since you tried to make two points simultaneously with an allegory insult sadly one point addressed a plan that only existed in your mind and the other took issue with behaviors that you do as much as anyone no no i finally got it you don t like the plan that nick s posts made you imagine and you don t like nick s obnoxious behavior even though it s no worse than your own thanks for taking the time with someone as dense as myself of course socrates how could it be otherwise who cares who came on the net first if you do consider that you saw me come on after a brief haitus before which i was on for about 2 years if you had seen me on the net first you d remember when nick and i went down exactly the same road regarding rude unneccesary behavior it s just amazing to me that you continue to take issue with behavior that s no worse than your own let s see here my complaints about your obnoxious behavior are hypocritical while your flames against people you decide are flamers isn t and my complaints about your name calling are immature while your name calling isn t yeah right maybe if you called me some more names i might see it better fred net ghod wannabe naturally fred you ve correctly interpreted my motivations when yours are impossible to judge from your actions as your insulting of people that try proves i didn t really care about people that fill the net with personal garbage what i really wanted was to impress everyone i only put my complaints with your behavior on private mail not because it belongs there but because i thought you were such a jerk that you d bring it back to the net playing right into my hands alas i had no idea what an intellectual master you were turning tables and bringing the history of these posts to the net for the noble and valuable purpose of embarassing me whether i should feel stupid because i tried to make suggestions to such a superior intellect or becuase i tried to communicate like an adult with a self righteous ass still isn t clear well fred you exposed me now i ll never be able to get a nother job with nasa since they all know that i m stupider than fred mccall well i just hope you re happy please leave me alone now i just don t have the heart to attempt keeping up with one so far above me maybe nick or pat can approach your high standards but i m dropping it now tommy mac tom mcwilliams 517 355 2178 wk as the radius of vision increases 18084tm ibm cl msu edu 336 9591 hm the circumference of mystery grows

tells what the acronyms stand for you re on your own for figuring out what they mean note also that the total number of acronyms in use far exceeds what i can list special purpose acronyms that are essentially always explained as they re introduced are omitted further some acronyms stand for more than one thing as of edition 3 of the list these acronyms appear on multiple lines unless they re simply different ways of referring to the same thing thanks to everybody who s sent suggestions since the first version of the list and especially to garrett a wollman wollman griffin uvm edu who is

3 | george it s called a democracy the majority rules sorry if ytou don t like it i suggest you modify the constitution to include a constitutional right to dark skies the theory of government here is that the majority rules except in the nature of fundamental civil rights if you really are annoyed get some legislation to create a dark sky zone where in all light emissions are protected in the zone kind of like the national radio quiet zone did you know about that near teh radio telescope observatory in west virginia they have a 90 mile emcon zone theoretically they can prevent you from running light ac motors like air conditioners and vacuums in practice they use it mostly to control large radio users

1 | i wouldn t bother with the copy protection if i were you if you program is any good the pirates will have stripped the protection and will be distributing the stripped version is well under a week hardware methods prevent j random loser from using his copy ii pc to pirate your software but doesn t stop anyone who knows a few people with enough connections to real pirates who _will_ be able to defeat your check for the hole code you may want to price your software depending on what it is a tad higher a price change from 15 to 25 probably would turn off very few potentials buyers and that way you could tolerate more pirates whose numbers don t change with the price as for the 20 pirating figure ha ha of course a lot of pirates just have this thing about having pirated software even if they never use it so perhaps that really wouldn t count towards 20 even so 20 is awfully low joel kolstad

2 | a folks do we have an faq on tinnitus yet b as a lo o o ong time sufferer of tinnitus and as a neuroscientist who has looked over the literature carefully i believe the following are reasonable conclusions 1 millions of people suffer from chronic tinnitus 2 the cause it not understood 3 there is no accepted treatment that cures it 4 some experimental treatments may have helped some people a bit but there have be no reports even anecdotal of massive good results with any of these experimental drugs 5 some people with chronic loud tinnitus use noise blocking to get to sleep 6 sudden onset loud tinnitus can be caused by injuries and sometimes abates or goes away after a few months 7 aspirin is well known to exacerbate tinnitus in some people 8 there is a national association of tinnitus sufferers in the us 9 one usually gets used to it especially when concentrating on something else the tinnitus becomes unnoticed 10 stress and lack of sleep make tinnitus more annoying sometimes 11 i m sure those of us who have it wish there was a cure but there is not

1 | the actual hourglass is hollow and is designed to generate a draft exploiting the venturi effect around the base of the hourglass is a ring of water towers warm river water coming from the steam condenser in the plant is sprayed over louvres the draft being pulled through the tower cools the water by both evaporation and convection the sensible heat extracted from the cooling water is the driving force for draft generation it should be noted that the hourglass shaped cooling towers are used on both fossile and nuclear plants it should also be noted that at locations where water is plentiful the cooling towers are only used part time when the discharge temperature would exceed some release limit it was once thought that the warm discharge water was damaging to fish fishermen know that is thoroughly incorrect nontheless stringent usually state regulations remain in some instances since it typically takes 60 000 hp worth of pumping to move the volume of water needed to cool a 1000 mwe plant the cost of using the towers is not insignificant

2 | the following is from a critique of a 60 minutes presentation on msg which was aired on november 3rd 1991 the critique comes from the tufts diet and nutrition letter february 1992 edited for brevity chances are good that if you watched 60 minutes last november 3rd 1991 you came away feeling msg is bad for you in the segment entitled no msg for instance show host ed bradley makes alarming statements without adequately substantiating them millions are suffering a host of symptoms and some get violently sick peppers his report with sensational but clinically unproven personal testimony and speaks of studies on msg that make the substance seem harmful without explaining just how inconclusive those studies are consider his making reference at the beginning of the program to a study conducted at the eastern virginia medical school in order to back up his comment that there is a lot of evidence that msg a flavor enhancer in chinese and other asian cuisines as well as in many supermarket items causes headaches what he does not make reference to is the fact that the study was performed not on humans but on rabbits one of the researchers who conducted the study pharmacologist patricia williams ph d says it certainly is conceivable that a small minority of people are sensitive enough to msg to get headaches from it but she explains the show probably overemphasized the extent of the problem a second lapse comes with mention of dr john olney a professor at the washington university school of medicine who mr bradley remarks says that his 20 years of research with laboratory animals shows msg is a hazard for developing youngsters because it poses a threat of irreversible brain damage dr olney s research with lab animals does not show anything about human youngsters in fact only under extreme circumsrtances did dr olney s experiments ever bring about any brain damage when he injected extremely high doses of msg into rodents completely bypassing their digestive tracts and entering their bloodstreams more directly and when he used tubes to force feed huge amounts of the substance to very young animals on an empty stomach of course neither of those procedures occurs with humans they simply take in msg with food and most of what they take in is broken down by enzymes in the wall of the small intestine so that very little reaches the bloodstream much to little in fact for human blood levels of msg to come anywhere near the high concentrations found in dr olney s lab animals the world health organization appears to be very much aware of that fact and so does the european communities scientific committee for food both after examining numerous studies have concluded that msg is safe their determination makes sense considering that msg has never been proven to cause all the symptoms that have been attributed to it headaches swelling a tightness in the chest and a burning sensation among others in fact the most fail safe of clinical studies the double blind study has consistently exonerated the much maligned substance that s quite fortunate since the alleged hazardous component of monosodium glutamate glutamate enters our systems whenever we eat any food that contains protein the reason is that one of the amino acids that make up protein glutamic acid is broken down into glutamate during digestion it s a breakdown that occurs frequently glutamic acid is the most abundant of the 20 or so amino acids in the diet it makes up about 15 percent of the protein in flesh foods 20 percent in milk 25 percent in corn and 29 percent in whole wheat that doesn t mean it s entirely unimaginable that a small number of people have trouble metabolizing msg properly and are therefore sensitive to it the consensus reached by large international professional organizations is that msg is safe the same consensus reached by the fda and the biomedical community at large

3 | for the purpose of a contest i d bet some things could be cut like fuel for re entry any kind of heat shielding etc etc even still if the contest participants had to fund dc 1 development it probably wouldn t be worth it to develop dc 1 just for the contest just give me the cheapest heaviest lift man rated or at least under 6 or so gs booster if i don t have to pay for dc 1 development great i ll use it but back to the contest goals there was a recent article in aw st about a low cost it s all relative manned return to the moon a general dynamics scheme involving a titan iv shuttle to lift a centaur upper stage lev and crew capsule the mission consists of delivering two unmanned payloads to the lunar surface followed by a manned mission total cost us was 10 13 billion joint esa nasa project was 6 9 billion for the us share i didn t find a mention of how long the crew could stay but i d bet that its around 30 days and the total payload delivered was about 30 metric tonnes so if you ignore the scientific payload hitch a ride in the crew habitation module no return trip and toss in a few more tonnes for the additional consumables to last another 11 months then you might be able to get a year visit out of 15 tonnes and in case its not obvious that s a wild ass guess a pretty boring visit since every trip outdoors eats up a bit of lox and i m not certain if a home brewed or college brewed life support system could last a year but let s round this up to 19 4 tonnes convient since the gd plan talks about 9 7 ton payloads delivered to the lunar surface this adds up to two centaurs two levs two shuttle flights all to put a single man on the moon for a year hmmm not really practical anyone got a cheaper better way of delivering 15 20 tonnes to the lunar surface within the decade anyone have a more precise guess about how much a year s supply of consumables and equipment would weigh and i was wondering about the gd lev is it reusable or is it discarded to burn up on return to leo if its not discarded could it be refueled henry do you know anything about the gd lev i noted that it uses rl 10 engines aren t they reusable restartable would a lev fit in a dc 1 i ve forgotten if i ever knew what the cargo bay dimensions are for the dc 1 all in all i m not certain that the single goal prize of staying on the moon for a year is wise and or useful how about a prize for the first non government sponsered unmanned moon landing then another for a manned moon landing then yet another for a system to extract consumables from lunar soil another for a reusable earth moon shuttle and so forth find some way to build civilian moonbase infrastructure having a single goal might result in a bunch of contestents giving up after one person appeared to win and for those that didn t give up i find something a little scary about a half dozen people huddling in rickety little moon shelters i d like to see as much a reward for co operation as for competition lastly about ten or fifteen years back i seem to recall that there was an english space magazine that had an on going discussion about moonbases on the cheap i recalled it discussed things like how much heat the human body produced how much lunar material it d need for protection from solar flares etc unfortunately i don t remember the name of this magazine does this ring a bell to anyone
2 | i recently attended an allery seminar steroid nasal sprays were discussed afterward on a one on one basis i asked the speaker what if none of the vancanese beconase nasalide nasalcort or nasalchrom work nor do any oral decongestants work she replied that she saw an article on vasomotor rhinitis that this is not an allergic reaction and that nothing other than the afrin s and such would work which in my case is true i want to find out as much as possible about this since i am going to see my allergist in may and want to be armed to the hilt with information since nothing he has done with me has helped me at all and i have had no relief for 14 months
3 | seems like a lot of trouble to go to its probably better to invest in newer launch systems i don t think a big cost advantage for using russian systems will last for very long maybe a few years lockheed would be the place to ask since you would probably have to buy the proton from them they market the proton world wide except russia they should know a lot about the possibilities i haven t heard them propose us launches so i assume they looked into it and found it unprofitable yes comparable to the zenit i suppose but since it looks like nothing will be built there you might just as well pick any spot the message is to launch now while its cheap and while russia and kazakstan are still cooperating later the story may be different

1 | unfortunately you re wrong on both counts the most common method of implementing a tunable receiver is to have a local oscillator the local oscillator s frequency can be radiated out of the receiver via the antenna unless the circuit is designed and constructed with great care for a reference on detecting radios get the paperback book _spy catcher_ the author discovered how to detect radio receivers from their local oscillator emissions back in the 1950s while he worked for british intelligence greg
3 | reported yesterday in the washington post kathy sawyer writer the article plays down the russian role in us space gibbons science advisor to clinton sent goldin a letter indicating nasa should not limit redesign options to those compatible with mir orbit the white house thinks expectations for russian cooperation have been raised too high the article reports that some think the spending and schedule limits for space station are so stringent that the redesign is nearly impossible that s why some think goldin has begun looking at russian hardware goldin states nasa will present all options to the administration which will then have decision making power goldin and the white house have totally ruled out using energia to boost the station
3 | voyager has the unusual luck to be on a stable trajectory out of the solar system all it s doing is collecting fields data and routinely squirting it down one of the mariners is also in stable solar orbit and still providing similiar solar data something in a planetary orbit is subject to much more complex forces comsats in stable geosynch orbits require almost daily stationkeeping operations for the occasional deep space bird like pff after pluto sure it could be left on auto pilot but things like galileo or magellan i d suspect they need enough housekeeping that even untended they d end up unusable after a while the better question should be why not transfer o m of all birds to a separate agency with continous funding to support these kind of ongoing science missions pat when ongoing ops are mentioned it seems to always quote operations and data analysis how much would it cost to collect the data and let it be analyzed whenever kinda like all that landsat data that sat around for 15 years before someone analyzed it for the ozone hole

1 | i think there is a huge difference in the materials and process for printer toner pcb s i get first time everytime results from a local hp postscript and hardly ever works from copies of the same artwork the printer results are so good that i have quit even looking for pc board processes if i had to use the copier version i would think i would look elsewhere the moral experiment and find what works toner transfer can give excellent results it like any process gives erratic results with variable inputs
3 | archive name space intro last modified date 93 04 01 14 39 10 frequently asked questions on sci space sci astro introduction this series of linked messages is periodically posted to the usenet groups sci space and sci astro in an attempt to provide good answers to frequently asked questions and other reference material which is worth preserving if you have corrections or answers to other frequently asked questions that you would like included in this posting send email to leech cs unc edu jon leech if you don t want to see the faq add frequently asked questions to your kill file for this group if you re not reading this with a newsreader that can kill articles by subject you re out of luck the faq volume is excessive right now and will hopefully be trimmed down by rewriting and condensing over time the faq postings are available in the ames space archive in faq faq good summaries will be accepted in place of the answers given here the point of this is to circulate existing information and avoid rehashing old answers better to build on top than start again nothing more depressing than rehashing old topics for the 100th time references are provided because they give more complete information than any short generalization questions fall into three basic types 1 where do i find some information about space try your local public library first the net is not a good place to ask for general information ask individuals by email if you must there are other sources use them too the net is a place for open ended discussion 2 i have an idea which would improve space flight hope you aren t surprised but 9 999 out of 10 000 have usually been thought of before again contact a direct individual source for evaluation nasa fields thousands of these each day 3 miscellanous

3 | in the april edition of one small step for a space activist allen sherzer tim kyger write another problem is what are called wraps or sometimes the center tax when work for a large program like freedom or shuttle is performed at a nasa center the center skims off a portion which goes into what amounts to a slush fund this money is used to fund work the center manager wants to fund this sum is estimated to be over a third of the funds allocated think about that of the 30 billion cost of freedom fully 10 billion won t be spent on anything having anything to do with space stations now maybe that 10 billion was wisely spent and maybe it wasn t but the work done with it should stand on its own merits not distorting the cost of other projects congress has no idea of the existense of these wraps congress has never heard the term center tax they look at the station they are getting and the price they are paying and note that it doesn t add up they wonder this blissfully unaware that a third of the money is going for something else my dear friends your mixing fact and fiction here a couple of weeks ago when i first read this in your posting i talked with one of the cost experts here in space station at headquarters if you wondering why i didn t post a response immediately i do have a real job i m supposed to be doing here at headquarters digging up old 20 khz data looking into sherzer kyger claims rates pretty low on the totem pole of priority also i spent last weekend in kansas city at the national science teachers association conference extolling the virtues of ssf to 15 000 science teachers first off yes the concept of center tax or wrap does exist if i recall the numbers correctly the total tax for the ssf program for this fiscal year is around 40 million this was computed by adding up the wp 1 wp 2 and wp 4 center taxes with the ssf budget for this fiscal year at 2 2 billion my calculater says the tax percentage is 04 2 2 1 8 over the life of the ssf program using your figure of 30 billion for the cost of ssf a tax at a 1 8 rate comes to 540 million this is alot less than 10 billion but i will concede it s still an appreciable amount of pocket change i should note that your estimate of the tax rate at 1 3 could be close to the actual rate the tax is only charged on funds that are spent at the center kind of like mcdonalds at some states where you do have to pay sales tax if you eat the food at the restaurant but you don t if you get it take out for example at wp 4 the vast bulk of the funds we receive go to the rocketdyne contract and are not subject to the center tax i don t have the numbers in front of me but i d guess at least 95 of the wp 4 funds go to rocketdyne so you could be right about a tax rate of 1 3 but it s only applied to funds spent at the center and not to the prime contracts this leads to the obvious question what is the government doing with ssf funds that don t go to the prime contractors i e ok wp 4 gets a slice of the 30 billion pie a big portion of this slice goes to rocketdyne what happens to the balance of the funds which aren t eaten up by the center tax at wp 4 we call these funds we spend in house supporting development funds as they are supporting the development work done by rocketdyne we have used these funds to setup our own testbed to checkout the electrical power system architecture our testbed has a real life solar array field left over from solar cell research research a few years back with lead acid car batteries to simulate the nickel hydrogen batteries on ssf dc switchgear dc dc converter units and simulated loads data from the testbed was used in a recent change evaluation involving concerns about the stability of the power system we have also used the supporting development money to purchase nickel hydrogen batteries which are on life testing at both lewis and the crane naval facility in indiana as a side point 6 of the battery cells on test recently hit the four year life test milestone 38 cells have completed 18 552 to 23 405 cycles the on orbit batteries go through 5 840 cycles per year as a final example my home division at lewis used the supporting development funds to purchase personal computers and work stations for performing system analyses like modeling of the performance of the electrical power system availability calculations using a monte carlo simulation setting up a database with information on weight of the power system elements finally the money raised by the tax does not all go into a slush fund at lewis the director does control a small discretionary fund each year any individual at lewis can submit a proposal to the director to get money from this fund to look at pretty much anything within the lewis charter most of the tax however goes to fund the general services at the center like the library the central computer services division the contractor who removes the snow etc thus it is rather difficult to determine what percentage of the ssf budget doesn t go for ssf activities to get an accurate figure you would have to take the annual expenditure for the library for example and then divide by the amount of the library funds used to support ssf which would be hard to compute by itself how would you figure out what percentage of the bill for aviation week for 1 year is billable to ssf would you base it on the person hours ssf employees spend reading av week versus the rest of the center personnel you would then have to compare this estimate of the ssf portion of the library expense with the portion of the tax that goes to support the library who knows maybe ssf overpays on the tax to run the library but we underpay for snow removal talk about a burecratic nightmare

3 | i attended a colloquium at goddard last fall where the head of the operations section of nasa was talking about what future missions were going to be funded i don t remember his name or title off hand and i have discarded the colloquia announcement in any case he was asked about that very matter why can t we spend a few million more to keep instruments that we already have in place going his responce was that there are only so many available to him and the lead time on an instrument like a cobe magellan hubble etc is 5 10 years minumum if he spent all that could be spent on using current instruments in the current budget enviroment he would have very little to nothing for future projects if he did that sure in the short run the science would be wonderful and he would be popular however starting a few years after he had retired he would become one of the greatest villans ever seen in the space community for not funding the early stages of the next generation of instruments just as he had benefited from his predicessor s funding choices he owed it to whoever his sucessor would eventually be to keep developing new missions even at the expense of cutting off some instruments before the last drop of possible science has been wrung out of them
3 | in fact you probably want to avoid us government anything for such a project the pricetag is invariably too high either in money or in hassles the important thing to realize here is that the big cost of getting to the moon is getting into low earth orbit everything else is practically down in the noise the only part of getting to the moon that poses any new problems beyond what you face in low orbit is the last 10km the actual landing and that is not immensely difficult of course you can spend sagadollars saga is the metric prefix for beelyuns and beelyuns on things other than the launches but you don t have to the major component of any realistic plan to go to the moon cheaply for more than a brief visit at least is low cost transport to earth orbit for what it costs to launch one shuttle or two titan ivs you can develop a new launch system that will be considerably cheaper delta clipper might be a bit more expensive than this perhaps but there are less ambitious ways of bringing costs down quite a bit any plan for doing sustained lunar exploration using existing launch systems is wasting money in a big way given this questions like whose launch facilities you use are not a minor detail they are very important to the cost of the launches which dominates the cost of the project

3 | there was an interesting article in scientific american some time ago about breathing liquid it was a few months before _the abyss_ came out as far as i can remember they mentioned three things that were difficult to do at once with a substitute breathing fluid low viscosity if it s too difficult to force the fluid in out of the lungs you can t extract enough oxygen to power your own breathing effort let alone anything else diffusion rate obviously not all the air in your lungs is expelled when you breathe out and the part that isn t expelled is the part that s nearest the walls of the alveoli alveolus so the trip from the blood vessels to the new air has to be done by diffusion of the gas through the fluid apparently oxygen tends to diffuse more readily than co2 so even if you can get enough oxygen in you might not be able to get enough co2 out oxygen co2 capacity you have to be able to dissolve enough gas per unit volume oh and of course your new breathing fluid must not irritate the lungs or interfere with their healing or anything like that

3 | i ve been to three talks in the last month which might be of interest i ve transcribed some of my notes below since my note taking ability is by no means infallible please assume that all factual errors are mine permission is granted to copy this without restriction michael sternberg cheif of operations of rimsat was invited to speak at an informal lunch held by acdis here on the campus of the university of illinois acdis is an organization on campus that deals with arms control disarmament and international security rimsat was considered an appropriate topic because the company is using russian launchers and satellites i think it also helped that his daughter is a grad student in the international relations program the concept behind rimsat apparently began when matt neilson went to tonga to visit a friend while he was there he somehow ended up visiting the king who happened to be a big tv fan matt bought the king a satellite dish which the king thought was really nifty since tonga has a gnp of about 70 million his majesty asked if there was any way to make money off this matt thought there probably was so at his suggestion tonga applied for 31 geosynchronous satellite slots while this isn t entirely off the wall it was very unusual seeing as tonga was a tiny kingdom with no space program and 31 is a lot of slots the whole thing was debated in the appropriate regulatory agency and carl hilliard who is apparently a respected space lawyer wrote several opinions supporting tonga s case eventually tonga ended up with 7 slots ranging from 70 e to 170 e slots are designated by the longitude over which they reside according to sternberg four of these from 130 e to 142 e are the best in the world because they are excellently placed for communications between hawaii and the pacific rim rimsat was formed to use these slots it was officially formed in nevis as a tax haven they tried for a few years to raise funds in the west however to fill 7 slots with western satellites launched on western launchers would have cost approximately 2 billion it s not easy to raise that kind of money eventually they hit upon the idea of using russian hardware they began negotiating with glavkosmos for hardware mr sternberg describes operating in moscow in such harsh terms that i don t think i ll visit there for a long time besides a significant lack of creature comforts he was not happy with the way that people operate for example everybody can sell you everything everyone can show the proper documents and licenses that indicate they are the only ones who have the authority to sell what ever you want to by eventually rimsat arranged a deal with glavkosmos for 6 satellites at a cost of 150 million however glavkosmos lost favor after the coup sternberg says that this is because they were basically a bunch of kgb operatives who went to trade shows and picked up lots of brochures since glavkosmos was out of power he had to renegotiate the deal with the new authorities he again described life in a moscow hotel in rather unfavorable terms eventually he worked out a deal and on dec 4 1992 he met with koptev who heads the russian space program to sign the deal koptev insisted on a few concessions before signing and according to sternberg he arranged these new rules to allow himself to form another company to do the exact same thing as rimsat the next step was to meet with the builders of the hardware npo applied mechanics npo pm to use their acronym this organization is located in siberia can t figure out how to spell the town i need an atlas and has built about 1500 vehicles since the dawn of the space age sternberg commented that siberians are very different from musovites they are hard workers honest people who team up to get things done very much like midwesterners at this point there were some comments from the audience that agreed with his opinion on both siberians and midwesterners sternberg had lots of good things to say about npo pm his company is apparently lookng for 100 million to invest in the firm to become 50 partners it apparently costs the russians about 4 million to build a satellite that would sell for 50 million in the west if you want to give them specifications they ll build you a satellite for the particular satellites that rimsat will be using costs run about 378 000 per transponder year this compares to 810 000 t y in the u s they can sell their time for about 1 1 million compared to 2 6 million in the u s rimsat will launch their satellites on protons to get the best prices they bought in bulk they have the rights to twelve launches so if any of you need a lift i can give you their address the first launch is scheduled for october and they are getting one used satellite from the russians which is being moved into place now tidbits sternberg says this kind of thing has to be done by entrepreneurs not big business because big business is just like what they have over there except that we have better paper both in the bathroom and in the copier russian launches are self insured the promise to replace a failed launch within 9 months major investors in rimsat include russell 20 20 which is a huge retirement fund organization cellsat which is a big telecom business in southeast asia and a fund operated by some of the big names in u s aerospace which he says is sort of an insurance policy for them if this really takes off he downplayed the instabilites in the ex ussr saying that we are worried partly because we aren t used to seeing russia as anything but an unvarying monolith italy gets a new government every two weeks but we don t worry because we re used to it he predicted that once we get used to seeing what really goes on in russia we won t worry about their stability as much part of the problem with cooperative ventures is the problem of transfering money the central bank has a policy of taking hard currency payments putting 25 in their coffers and replacing the rest with the equivalent value in rubles to get around this rimsat pays their hard currency into an austrian bank account npo pm then pays their contractors with foreign currency so that the only the contractors get swindled by the government one of the big problems rimsat has had is stonewalling by the western satellite industry however intelsat recently bought three of the same type of satellites which was rather reassuring the biggest worry most people have about russian satellites is the primitive technology and shorter lifetime the older gorizont horizon satellites have a lifetime of about 5 years while the more modern express satellites compare well with western technology and last about 8 years while this is much shorter than 15 years for western satellites sternberg downplayed the difference at these prices they can afford to launch new ones in addition shorter lifetimes mean that they can replace their equipment with newer technology so they will be able to compete better than older out of date hardware
3 | i found it very interesting that atlas depended on pressure to maintain tank geometry leads me to the question have any of the ssto concepts explored pressurized tankage such that the launch configuration would be significantly different from the reentry one i have long been facinated by pnumatic structures as conceived and built by frei otto and others a ballon tank ssto sounds very clever

3 | i haven t seen any speculation about it but the salyut kb design bureau was planning a new lh lox second stage for the proton which would boost payload to leo from about 21000 to 31500 kg geostationary goes from 2600 kg gals launcher version to 6000 kg this scheme was competing with the energia m last year and i haven t heard which won except now i recently read that the central specialized kb was working on the successor to the soyuz booster which must be the energia m so the early results are energia m won but this is a guess nothing is very clear in russia i m sure if salyut kb gets funds from someone they will continue their development the centaur for the altas is about 3 meters dia and the proton is 4 so that s a good fit for their existing upper stage the block d which sets inside a shround just under 4 meters dia i don t know about launch loads etc but since the centaur survives titan launches which are probably worse than the proton those titan srb s probably shake things up pretty good it seems feasible except the centaur is a very fragile thing and may require integration on the pad which is not available now protons are assembled and transported horizontially does anyone know how much stress in the way of a payload a centaur could support while bolted to a proton horizontally and then taken down the rail road track and erected on the pad they would also need lox and lh facilities added to the proton pads unless the new proton second stage is actually built and of course any centaur support systems and facilities no doubt imported from the us at great cost these systems may viloate us law so there are political problems to solve in addition to the instabilities in the cis you mention

1 | mjm hi i was wondering if anyone would be able to help me on twwo related mjm subjects i am currently learning about am fm receivers and recieving mjm circuits i understand a lot of things but a few things i am confused mjm abuot the first is the mixer to mix the rf and local oscillator mjm frequencies to make the if does anyone have any cicruit diagrams as mjm simple as possible for this kind of mixer i have come across a mjm mc sbl mixer chip but i have not been able to find it in any catalogs mjm active etc mjm along the same note are there any simple fm receiver circuits anyone mjm may have stashed away somewhere and they couold let me see mjm p s any really good books on am fm theory along with detailed mjm electrical diagrams would help a lot mjm i have seen a lot of theory books with no circuits and a lot of mjm circuit books with no theory but one without the other does not help digi key has the ne 622 chip which has a local oscillator and mixer on one chip for a great combination of theory with actual circuits the best reference for non engineers is probably the radio amateur s handbook from the arrl most library s have it in the reference section slmr 2 1 if ignorance is bliss why aren t there more happy folk

2 | you are making precisely one of the points i wanted to make i fully agree with you that there is a big distinction between the process of science and the end result as an end result of science one wants to get results that are objectively verifiable but there is nothing objective about the process of science if good empirical research were done and showed that there is some merit to homeopathic remedies this would certainly be valuable information but it would still not mean that homeopathy qualifies as a science this is where you and i disagree with turpin in order to have science one must have a theoretical structure that makes sense not a mere collection of empirically validated random hypotheses experiment and empirical studies are an important part of science but they are merely the culmination of scientific research the most important part of true scientific methodology is scientific thinking without this one does not have any hypotheses worth testing no hypotheses do not just leap out at you after you look at enough data nor do they simply come to you in a flash one day while you re shaving or looking out the window at least not unless you ve done a lot of really good thinking beforehand the difference between a nobel prize level scientist and a mediocre scientist does not lie in the quality of their empirical methodology it depends on the quality of their thinking it really bothers me that so many graduate students seem to believe that they are doing science merely because they are conducting empirical studies and it bothers me even more that there are many fields such as certain parts of psychology where there seems to be no thinking at all but mere studies testing ad hoc hypotheses and i m especially offended by russell turpin s repeated assertion that science amounts to nothing more than avoiding mistakes simply avoiding mistakes doesn t get you anywhere in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

1 | was to snip i haven t been following this so i m sorry if somebody already mentioned this but you could grab a lemon i think potatoes work too but i m not sure a strip of copper and a strip of zinc i think you can get the metal in a hardware store or hobby shop maybe stick the strips in the lemon so they don t touch and you ll get a measurable voltage not a lot but hey it s a lemon as i recall we had to hook something like ten of these things to get an appreciable amount of current because of the mondo internal resistance but if you just need a demo you might get it to run a tiny fan or something

2 | if she is having problems with fresh vegetables the guess is that there is some obstruction of the intestine without knowing more it is not possible to say whether the obstruction is permanent due to scarring or temporary due to swelling of inflammed intestine in general there are no dietary limitations in patients with crohn s except as they relate to obstruction there is no evidence that any foods will bring on recurrence of crohn s it is important to distinguish recurrence from recurrent symptoms a physician would think of new inflammation as recurrence while pains from raw veggies just imply a narrowing of the intestine your friend should look into membership in the crohn s and colitis foundation of america 1 800 932 2423 good luck to your friend

2 | a very simple question it seems to me that the contraceptive pill just prevents the ovule to nest in the vagina and forces it to fall every month but it does not prevent the fertilzation of the ovule is it true if yes is there a risk of extra uterine pregnancy that is the development of the ovule inside the fallopian tube actually that is not how the pill works but it is how the iud works the oral contraceptive pill actually prevents ovulation from occuring by providing negatve feedback to the pituitary gland and thus preventing the lh surge that normally occurs at the time of ovulation with the iud what happens is that fertilization may occur but the device prevents implantation within the wall of the uterus not the vagina

2 | there are many organisms viral bacterial and fungal which can cause meningitits and the course of these infections varies widely the causes of bacterial meningitis vary with age in adults pneumococcus the same organism which causes pneumococcal pneumonia is the most common cause while in children hemophilus influenzae is the most common cause what you are describing is meningitis from neisseria meningitidis which is the second most common cause of bacterial meningitis in both groups but with lower incidence in infants this organism is also called the meningococcus and is the source of the common epidemics of meningitis that occur and are popularized in the press without prompt treatment and even with it in some cases the organism typically causes death within a day this organism feared as it is is actually grown from the throats of many normal adults it can get to the meninges by different ways but blood borne spread is probably the usual case rifampin an oral antibiotic is often given to family and contacts of a case of meningococcal meningitis by the way sorry but i don t have time for a more detailed reply meningitis is a huge topic and sci med can t do it justice

3 | i once read an article on computer technology which stated that every new computer technology was actually lower and slower then what it replaced silicon was less effective then the germanium products then available gaas was less capable then silicon multi processors were slower then existent single processors what the argument was though was that these new technologies promised either theoretically future higher performance or lower cost or higher densities i think that the dc 1 may g fit into this same model elv s can certainly launch more weight then a ssrt but an ssrt offers the prospect of greater cycle times and lower costs this is kind of a speculative posting but i thought i d throw it out as a hjistorical framework for those interested in the project

1 | fyi the actual horizontal dot placement resoution of an hp deskjet is 1 600th inch the electronics and dynamics of the ink cartridge however limit you to generating dots at 300 per inch on almost any paper the ink wicks more than 1 300th inch anyway the method of depositing and fusing toner of a laster printer results in much less spread than ink drop technology it doesn t take much investigation to see that the mechanical and electronic complement of a laser printer is more complex than inexpensive ink jet printers recall also that laser printers offer a much higher throughput 10 ppm for a laser versus about 1 ppm for an ink jet printer something else to think about is the cost of consumables over the life of the printer a 3000 page yield toner cartridge is about us 75 80 at discount while hp high capacity 500 1000 page yield cartridges are about us 22 at discount it could be that over the life cycle of the printer that consumables for laser printers are less than ink jet printers it is getting progressively closer between the two technologies laser printers are usually desinged for higher duty cycles in pages per month and longer product replacement cycles

1 | here s something i posted about this a few years ago it s not fully up to date with all the new variations some of which are just different manufacturer s synonyms in practical terms ignoring the technological details this is my view of the families nb i am not a giant corporation which influences my views on things like availability and backward compatibility 74 the original speed good power consumption fair effectively obsolete now use 74ls or later except for a very few oddball functions like 7407 which are hard to find in newer families 74h modification of 74 for higher speed at the cost of higher power consumption very obsolete use 74f 74l modification of 74 for lower power at the cost of lower speed very obsolete use cmos 74s later modification of 74 for even higher speed at some cost in power consumption effectively obsolete use 74f 74ls combination of 74l and 74s for speed comparable to 74 with lower power consumption best all round ttl now widest variety of devices 74f fast as blazes power not too bad the clear choice for high speed in ttl availability and prices generally good 74as failed competitor to 74f although a few 74as parts do things that are hard to find in 74f and thus are still useful 74als possible replacement for 74ls generally souped up still fairly new availability and prices possibly a problem 74c fairly old family cmos devices with ttl pinouts competed with 4000 series not too successfully obsolete use 4000 or newer cmos 74 families 4000 thrown in as the major non 74 non ecl logic family the old cmos family still viable because of very wide range of devices low power consumption and wide range of supply voltages not fast very forgiving and easy to work with beware static electricity but that comment applies to many other modern logic families too there are neat devices in this family that exist in no other the clear choice when speed is not important 74hc a new attempt at 74 pinout cmos fast compared to old cmos power consumption often lower than ttl possibly a good choice for general purpose logic assuming availability and affordability cmos logic levels not ttl ones beware very limited range of supply voltages compared to older cmos also major rise of power consumption at faster speeds 74hct 74hc with ttl logic levels much the same comments as 74hc read the fine print on things like power consumption ttl compatibility in cmos involves some compromises 10k thrown in for speed freaks the low end of ecl various sources claim that it is easier to work with than super fast ttl for serious high speed work less forgiving though read and follow the rules or it won t work availability to hobbyists limited can be expensive 100k for real speed freaks hot ecl harder to handle than 10k and inconvenient packages much more useful datasheets however as for compatibility between families the 74 families except 74c and 74hc are all more or less logic level compatible but how many 74x devices you can drive from one 74y output varies enormously with x and y you just have to read the specs and do the arithmetic 74c and 74hc are compatible with the others with a bit of hassle 4000 compatibility can be a bit of hassle or a lot of hassle depending on what supply voltage 4000 is using 10k or 100k to anything else is considerable hassle me i use 4000 and 74ls with a sprinkling of 74f 74hc t and 10k are interesting but i haven t used either significantly yet
3 | of course sorry for the misunderstanding i was referring to the fact that far more aeronautical development took place in the 30 s for much of the 20 s the super abundance of jennies and ox 5 engines held down the industry by 1926 many of the obsolete wwi aircraft had been retired and whirlwind had their power weight ratio and reliability up to the point where long distance flights became practical it s important to note that the atlantic was flown not once but three times in 1927 lindbergh chamberlin and levine and byrd s _america_ when it s time to railroad you railroad not off the top of my head i ll have to dig out my reference books again however i will say that the most common arrangement in prince henry the navigator s portugal was for the prince to put up part of the money and merchants to put up the rest they profits from the voyage would then be shared the problem is that the amount of prize money required to inspire a moon base is much larger than any but a handful of individuals or corporations can even consider putting up the kremer prizes human powered aircraft orteig s prize lord northcliffe s prize for crossing the atlantic won in 1919 by alcock and brown were much smaller the technologies required were within the reach of individual inventors and the prize amounts were well within the reach of a large number of wealthy individuals i think that only a gov t could afford to set up a 1b prize for any purpose whatsoever note that burt rutan suggested that nasp could be built most cheaply by taking out an ad in avweek stating that the first company to build a plane that could take off and fly the profile would be handed 3b no questions asked
2 | here is a press release from the natural resources defense council new data show about 100 major u s water supplies vulnerable to milwaukee type disease outbreak to national desk environment writer contact erik olson or sarah silver 202 783 7800 both of the natural resources defense council washington april 14 internal epa data released today by the natural resources defense council reveals that about 100 large water systems serving cities from boston to san francisco do not filter to remove disease carrying organisms leaving those communities potentially vulnerable to a disease outbreak similar to the one affecting milwaukee the epa list is attached these internal epa documents reveal that the safety of water supplies in many american cities is threatened by inadequate pollution controls or filtration said erik olson a senior attorney with nrdc water contamination isn t just a problem in bangladesh it s also a problem in bozeman and boston as of june 29 1993 about 100 large surface water systems on epa s list probably will be breaking the law the 1986 safe drinking water act requires all surface water systems to either filter their water or fully protect the rivers or lakes they use from pollution olson continued some systems are moving towards eventually implementing filtration systems but are expected to miss the law s deadline olson pointed out that the threat of contamination is already a reality in other cities a 1991 survey of 66 u s surface water systems by water utility scientists found that 87 percent of raw water samples contained the milwaukee organism cryptosporidium and 81 percent contained a similar parasite called giardia adding to the level of concern a general accounting office study released today by house health and environment subcommittee chairman henry waxman indicates serious deficiencies in the nation s system for conducting and following through on sanitary surveys of water systems this new information raises a huge warning sign that millions of americans can no longer simply turn on their taps and be assured that their water is safe to drink we must immediately put into place programs to protect water sources from contamination and where this is not assured filtration equipment must be installed to protect the public olson noted the time has come for many of the nation s water utilities to stop dragging their feet and to aggressively protect their water from contamination consumers are prepared to pay the modest costs needed to assure their water is safe to drink nrdc is a national non

1 | hi i ve just built a valve preamp and use a diode capacitor voltage multiplier to step the 12vac supply voltage up to approx 260vdv as the load resistance increases the rc constant decreases and hence the output voltage drops i need as high an output voltage as possible about 260v the circuit consists of seven voltage multiplier stages ie 14 diodes and 14 capacitors each capacitor develops about 38v across them and i take the output from across seven capacitors 260v each capacitor is 100mfd at 68v if i increase each of the capacitors rating 220 470mfd that will increase the rc constant and hence alleviate some of the problem these capacitors are going to be a little expensive as i need 14 of them so 1 what would happen if i connected a 470mfd at 400v capacitor in parallel with the output and hence in parallel with the seven 100mfd capacitors will it as i assume increase the c in circuit and hence increase the rc time constant if it does and my output voltage becomes more stable by doing this then i will have killed two birds with one stone as i am experiencing some 50hz ripple and hence amp hum and this new capacitor will smooth this out and 2 can anyone recomend a suitable value for an inductor choke to be placed in the output line of the power supply to filter out the 50hz mains hum lowest resistance possible i ve not got my preamp with me at the moment because it is too much of a distraction i m at university and i ve got to get my dissertation finished in two weeks hence i m mailing not playing with my solderoing iron it ll be cheaper too in the long run especially if 14 new large capacitors don t work as planned email please can t always read the net thanks in advance chris name mr chris smith twang on that ole guitar addrs scst83 uk ac liv csc uni liverpool university quest to build more and more hardware dgree computer science what ever the sun may be it is certainly not a ball of flaming gas d h lawrence

2 | i recently had a case of shingles and my doctors wanted to give me intravenous acyclovir it was a pain finding iv sites in my arms can i have some facts about how advantageous it is to give intravenous antibiotics rather than oral i think some essential information must be missing here i e you must be suffering from a condition which has caused immunosuppression there is no indication for iv acyclovir for shingles in an otherwise healthy person the oral form can help to reduce the length of symptoms and may even help prevent the development of post herpetic neuralgia but i certainly would not subject someone to iv therapy without a good reason to address your more general question iv therapy does provide higher and more consistently high plasma and tissue levels of a drug for treating a serious infection this is the only way to be sure that a patient is getting adequate drug levels
2 | i recently attended an allery seminar steroid nasal sprays were discussed afterward on a one on one basis i asked the speaker what if none of the vancanese beconase nasalide nasalcort or nasalchrom work nor do any oral decongestants work she replied that she saw an article on vasomotor rhinitis that this is not an allergic reaction and that nothing other than the afrin s and such would work which in my case is true there has been some recent research on vasomotor rhinitis that shows that ipratroprium bromide atrovent inhaled nasally is an effective treatment for many sufferers it has been approved for this use and is available with a nasal adaptor in canada in the us the fda has yet to approve this use of the drug but it is available as an oral inhaler for copd and these can be adapted for intranasal use

low levels of airborne particles linked to serious asthma attacks american lung association a new study published by the american lung association has shown that surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment the seattle based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution the actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws people with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation said joel schwartz ph d of the environmental protection agency who was the lead author of the study when people are on the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over the edge the seattle study correlated 13 months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of pm or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of 10 microns or less these finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the 24 hour average concentration of pm10 exceeds 150 micrograms per cubic millimeter of air in seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as 30 micrograms the authors concluded that for every 30 microgram increase in the four day average of pm10 the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by 12 percent the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory disease an official journal of the american thoracic society the lung association s medical section the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat a 1992 study by dr schwartz and douglas dockery ph d of harvard found that particles may be causing roughly 60 000 premature deaths each year in the united states other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone says dr schwartz but more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well one problem in setting standards for particulate air pollution is that pmio is difficult to study unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and hicnet medical newsletter page 29 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 acid aerosols researchers can t put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution says dr schwartz we have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles consequently most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population based research like the seattle study given that the epa s current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm10 standard any time soon until changes are made there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles in some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and that s rarely particulate matter says dr schwartz however pm10 doesn t have to be near its violation range to be unhealthy hicnet medical newsletter page 30 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 nih consensus development conference on melanoma the national institutes of health consensus development conference on diagnosis and treatment of early melanoma brought together experts in dermatology pathology epidemiology public education surveillance techniques and potential new technologies as well as other health care professionals and the public to address 1 the clinical and histological characteristics of early melanoma 2 the appropriate diagnosis management and followup of patients with early melanoma 3 the role of dysplastic nevi and their significance and 4 the role of education and screening in preventing melanoma morbidity and mortality following 2 days of presentations by experts and discussion by the audience a consensus panel weighed the scientific evidence and prepared their consensus statement among their findings the panel recommended that 1 melanoma in situ is a distinct entity effectively treated surgically with 0 5 centimeter margins 2 thin invasive melanoma less than 1 millimeter thick has the potential for long term survival in more than 90 percent of patients after surgical excision with a 1 centimeter margin 3 elective lymph node dissections and extensive staging evaluations are not recommended in early melanoma 4 patients with early melanoma are at low risk for relapse but may be at high risk for development of subsequent melanomas and should be followed closely 5 some family members of patients with melanoma are at increased risk for melanoma and should be enrolled in surveillance programs and 6 education and screening programs have the potential to decrease morbidity and mortality from melanoma a copy of the full text of the consensus panel s statement is available by calling the nih office of medical applications of

6 number 10 april 20 1993 nci designated cancer centers the cancer centers program is comprised of 55 nci designated cancer centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence morbidity and mortality within the program there are four types of cancer centers basic science cancer centers 14 which engage primarily in basic cancer research clinical cancer centers 12 which focus on clinical research comprehensive cancer centers 28 which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community outreach and consortium cancer centers 1 which specialize in cancer prevention and control research although some cancer centers existed in the late 1960s and the 1970s it was the national cancer act of 1971 that authorized the establishment of 15 new cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones the passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and cancer control research over the next two decades the centers program grew progressively in 1990 there were 19 comprehensive cancer centers in the nation today there are 28 of these institutions all of which meet specific nci criteria for comprehensive status to attain recognition from the nci as a comprehensive cancer center an institution must pass rigorous peer review under guidelines newly established in 1990 the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a cancer center support grant also referred to as a p30 or core grant the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center s operations these criteria encompass strong participation in nci designated high priority clinical trials significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important outreach and educational activities all of which are funded by a variety of sources the other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions hicnet medical newsletter page 32 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 of the 55 nci designated cancer centers 14 are of the basic science type these centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs there are 12 such centers today finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research these centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population wide public health programs consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials together the 55 nci designated cancer centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research from the laboratory into clinical trials and into clinical practice comprehensive cancer centers internet addresses are

vaccines reuters 04 08 93 frank jacqueline washington the clinton administration will permit the national institutes of health to test multiple aids vaccines instead of only allowing the army to test a single vaccine administration sources said thursday the decision ends the controversy between army aids researchers who had hoped to test a vaccine made by microgenesys inc and the national institutes of health which contended that multiple vaccines should be tested health and human services secretary donna shalala said a final announcement on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last friday companies including genentech inc chiron corp and immuno ag have already told nih that they are prepared to participate in the vaccine tests the testing is intended to demonstrate whether aids vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of hiv in patients already infected shalala refuted last week s reports that the clinton administration had decided the army s test of the microgenesys vaxsyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time the report was inaccurate and i expect there to be some announcement in the next 24 hours about that particular aids research project said shalala administration sources subsequently confirmed that nih director dr bernadine healy and food and drug administration commissioner david kessler had convinced the white house that multiple vaccines should be tested simultaneously but microgenesys president frank volvovitz said a test of multiple vaccines could triple the cost of the trial and

however a team of european researchers recently reported that although hiv positive patients taking azt demonstrated a slightly lower risk of developing aids within the first year of treatment that benefit disappeared two years later the lancet published preliminary findings of the three year study which could give more reason for critics to argue the drug s cost side effects and general efficacy even though u s researchers concede the study was more comprehensive than american trials many argue the european researchers suggestion that hiv positive patients experience little

2 | i think that part of the problem is that i have proposed a definition of science that i intended to be interpreted broadly and that lee lady has interpreted fairly narrowly my definition is this science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as a mistake they fall under my definition i hope no one would consider speculation thinking and informal exploration as unscientific here is where i think we are talking at cross purposes it is not clear to me that the kind of definition i have proposed should be taken as describing what science is mainly about consider for example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone this fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about one can read this definition and still not know that 95 of all animal species are invertebrates that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form that some invertebrate groups such as insects and nematodes are ubiquitous in all ecosystems etc in short knowing the definition of invertebrates does not tell one what they are mainly about the misunderstanding here is my fault i did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition i agree on both counts as an example of the second it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls as to the first i do not think it is useful to talk about absolute scientific truth i think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence in particular fields that in the past have proven faulty or reliable the latter is obviously a matter of degree and in each field practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence one of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others it is perfectly alright to speculate i have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right but the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative to list what little evidence was presently available for them and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work it is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail i think a lot of scientists steer away from things that deserving or not garner a patina of kookiness when proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in many researchers minds this is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy on the other hand i can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research as gordon banks has pointed out no one wants to become this generation s rhine i think this is absurd i wonder why the results were not published in my field dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished this certainly eases one s defense finally i hope lee lady will forgive me from commenting either on nlp or the discussion of it in sci psychology i know little about either and so have nothing to offer

1 | yes but the minimization of gates is important in part because of timing considerations a ttl gate has the basic structure of and or invert and an inversion of a sum of a product is just exactly one gate delay the reason to find a minimal sum of products is that this matches a hardware optimization a positive or gate such as the 9 gate solution uses has two gate delays and there s another gate delay in the second term so that the second solution while simpler in logic symbols can be expected to be something less than optimal in the real world ecl is similar to ttl in that it can support an or and gate with the minimum delay unlike ttl you get both true and inverse outputs for free when using ecl pals are basically large programmable and or invert gates with your choice of internal connections between the various sections and perhaps some latches so a minimum sum of products also is a way to shoehorn a logic design into a few pals it s not comparably easy to design with a minimization of logic gates but some software packages claim to allow you to do so and will take just about any mess of gates as a nodelist with 74xxx series logic ics and produce a description of a logic cell array to do the same job xilinx s xact software does this by treating each logic block as a macro and expanding it all out then simplifying

1 | hello let me introduce a problem when i measure a sinusoidal wave voltage with a digital voltmeter using ac mode my output is an rms value a peak value over 2 squared right when i measure a square wave in the same mode ac my output is equal to a peak value actually to the upper flat boundary of the wave i assumed that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the input value and divides it over the wave period right now i used it to measure the same square wave as above but distorted by high frequency harmonics ideally output should be the same but the output value was only about 10 of the previous one why what is the nature of this output value what does the voltmeter actually measure and what does it show related question less important to me what are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with analog ones thank you for your attention you could mail me your opinion at avm1993 zeus tamu edu or open a discussion here i would appreciate either way alexander v mamishev ____________________________________________________________________________ power system automation laboratory phone office 409 845 4623 department of electrical engineering phone home 409 846 5850 texas a m university fax 409 862 2282 college station tx 77843 usa internet avm1993 zeus tamu edu

the date of this month s meeting i m posting it anyway and posting it world wide instead of regional in the hopes that some of the information may be useful or illustrative also i hope it can be used as an example and inspiration for the posting of other newsletters and data related to organ transplantation and donation mike transplant recipients international organization long island chapter p o box 922 huntington ny 11743 0922 newsletter 516 421 3258 april 1993 volume iv no 8 next meeting the next meeting is wednesday april 14 at 8 pm at the knights of columbus emerald manor 517 uniondale avenue in uniondale our guest speaker will be dr lewis teperman dr teperman trained in pittsburgh under dr starzl and is now the assistant director of the liver transplant program at new york university medical center dr teperman will discuss current trends in transplantation and treatment and will answer questions he is a long time friend of trio surgeon to many of our members and always a gracious and delightful guest it is sure to be a very informative interesting and engaging evening our hospitality committee bette and vito suglia and jim spence will be well prepared and at last the weather should be cooperative we hope to see a very large gathering to welcome dr teperman wednesday april 14 k of c uniondale last meeting it has been noted here before that the long island chapter of trio has extraordinary power in predicting bad weather being able to forecast rain sleet and snow fully a month in advance no tv weatherman can match us this time we not only scored again but we were also able to disable the long island railroad making travel really difficult none the less many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation our scheduled speaker mrs elizabeth linnehan a professional nutritionist had a family emergency and was not able to attend she hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications however ms jennifer friedman an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice ms friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup even a bit for men to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take we are most grateful to jennifer and thank her for an entertaining evening annual meeting in addition to welcoming dr teperman the april meeting is also the annual meeting of the chapter this is the official notice of the meeting as required by our by laws the main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet their needs and to elect members of the board of directors for the coming two year term the nominating committee has prepared the following slate for the board anne liver recipient and don treffeisen robert heart recipient and eulene smith vito kidney recipient and bette suglia kay grenzig liver recipient jan schichtel kidney recipient larry juliano kidney recipient david bekofsky director public education litp those remaining on the board for another year are robert carroll liver kidney pancreas recipient jerry kidney recipient and jeanne eichhorn ron kidney donor and marie healy peter smith bone marrow recipient patricia ann yankus kidney and pancreas recipient walter ruzak kidney recipient this may seem to be a big board but many hands make light work and with our various medical uncertainties it is good to have backups for all the jobs on the board therefore in addition to the slate being presented for voting nominations will also be accepted from the floor there is no set number of board members and there is plenty of work in addition brief treasurer s and membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business suggestions or comments anyone would like to bring up we will keep the formal meeting short so that we can spend the majority of the time with dr teperman future meetings remember the scheduled guests for the rest of the year may 12 dr peter shaprio chief of psychiatry columbia presbyterian medical center june 9 dr

awareness week notdaw while we are planning news releases speaking engagements and meetings with supervisors gullata and gaffney we have decided not to have our softball game because of two year s experience with miserable weather we all can help spread the word on donor awareness however we have found it effective to ask your pastor or rabbi to publish a letter or announcement in the parish bulletin allow you to address the congregation or include mention of the gift of life in his sermon attached to this newsletter is a sample letter and fact sheet you can use thank you dr starzl to be honored the long island chapter of the american liver foundation will hold its annual auction and dinner dance on may 7th at the fountainbleu on jericho turnpike in jericho dr thomas starzl will be

1 | i was having a look through a couple of components catalogues when i came across a range of peltier effect heat pumps intended for cooling components for those who have not heard of this effect you put a current through one of these devices and it pumps heat from one side to the other reverse the current and you reverse the effect i think a temperature difference can give you an emf as well anyway it struck me that you could make a nice cool hot box for picnics with one of these a power regulator a thermostat and a couple of heat sinks the biggest device can shift 60w with an efficiency of 80 90 which ain t bad although it would flatten my car battery in about half an hour unfortunately the catalogue didn t list anything more than the basic specs as a heat pump i imagine that you would get a back emf as the temperature gradient across the device increases if so presumably its power decreases as the back emf increases until eventually we have a steady state with no current being consumed assuming no leakage if so then the final temperature difference between the two sides could be set by the supply voltage and nothing more although that would be a lousy way to control it what i would like to know is 1 are the above guesses correct 2 what is the open circuit thermal resistance of a typical device i just want to be sure that my coolbox is not going to get warm too fast when i unplug it 3 how does a peltier effect heat pump actually work it looks like magic 4 why don t they use these things in domestic fridges freezers thanks in advance paul
3 | lets hear it for dan goldin now if he can only convince the rest of our federal government that the space program is a worth while investment i hope that i will live to see the day we walk on mars but we need to address the technical hurdles first if there s sufficient interest maybe we should consider starting a sci space group devoted to the technical analysis of long duration human spaceflight most of you regulars know that i m interested in starting this analysis as soon as possible
1 | hi being a electronic engineering student with only electronic ii under my belt i find myself needing to build a moderate wattage audio amp so i ll throw out a couple of question for the vast knowledge of the net please explain how watts are calculated in audio amp circuits no not p i e just how it relates to one of the following ai current gain av voltage gain ap power gain or whatever i already have a wonderful cheap i e 20 schematic for a 20w amp but i would like to cross improve the circuit the problem is that the parts list has ic1 and ic2 as nec70001ab amplifiers they look like 11 pin sip packages with a heatsink this schematic was published in a 1991 mag so it may be non existant now anyway i tried looking up a replacement in the latest digi key cat and found it not listed 8 the closes i could figure was a 9 pin sip as tda1520bu anyone got any ideas i thought hey i can rin a pspice simulation using 741 opamp models yea great it worked but i guess the 741 wasn t made for high power amps as a result i got a voltage gain of 15mv v worse than i started with 8 does anyone have a pspice ckt file with cheap yet good gain how about some models for some of the chips listed in this e mail any ascii chip info you guys can send me i m open to suggestions ideas comments help please e mail since i have little time to search the news and i ll post if there s and interest john
3 | just a bit off phil we don t reprocess nuclear fuel because what you get from the reprocessing plant is bomb grade plutonium it is also cheaper given current prices of things to simply fabricate new fuel rods rather than reprocess the old ones creating potentially dangerous materials from a national security point of view and then fabricate that back into fuel rods fabricating with reprocessed plutonium may result in something that may go kind of boom but its hardly decent bomb grade plutonium if you want bomb grade plutonium use a research reactor not a power reactor but if you want a bomb don t use plutonium use uranium
3 | stuff deleted i m glad to see that someone is working on this however it would be nice if he got his units right
1 | hi people ok heres my problem i keep hearing about these little credit card type of things which detect ir light i believe that you have to charge them up under normal visible light and then if they are exposed to ir light they glow or something like that i think that they are avaliable in the states and even in england but alas i live in australia could someone please inform me if i can get these things over here and if so where and how much also are they really commonly avaliable in the states and if so then how much are they and who sells them maybe if i cant get one here i ll write to one of the companies over seas anyway thanks in advance

2 | i was wondering if anyone had any information about molluscous contagiosem i acquired it and fortunately got rid of it but the question still lingers in my mind where did it come from the little bit of info that i have received about it in the past states that it can be transmitted sexually but also occurs in small children on the hands feet and genitalia any information will be greatly appreciated i grow old i grow old i shall wear my trousers rolled

3 | i was suggesting that the minority of professional and amateur astronomers have the right to a dark uncluttered night sky let me give you an example when you watch tv they have commercials to pay for the programming you accept that as part of watching if you don t like it you can turn it off if you want to view the night sky and there is a floating billboard out there you can t turn it off it s the same reasoning that limits billboards in scenic areas george it s called a democracy the majority rules sorry if ytou don t like it i suggest you modify the constitution to include a constitutional right to dark skies the theory of government here is that the majority rules except in the nature of fundamental civil rights i say any reasonably in depth perusal of american history will show you that many wasps have continued the practices of prejudice discrimination and violence against others of different races religions and beliefs despite the law if you really are annoyed get some legislation to create a dark sky zone where in all light emissions are protected in the zone kind of like the national radio quiet zone did you know about that near teh radio telescope observatory in west virginia they have a 90 mile emcon zone theoretically they can prevent you from running light ac motors like air conditioners and vacuums in practice they use it mostly to control large radio users i say what i m objecting to here is a floating billboard that presumably would move around in the sky i for one am against legislating at all i just wish that people had a bit of common courtesy and would consider how their greed for money impacts the more ethereal and aesthetic values that make us human this includes the need for wild and unspoiled things including the night sky george
1 | yes i use 74hc4066 and others commerically for this purpose so rest assured it works fine in one case i route bit serial digital audio using these and it is difficult to see any signal degradation at all which surprised me given some pretty fast edges hc4066 is spec d at something like 3db 200mhz into 50 ohms the more complex types are generally a little slower and more resistive plain 4000 series are not so good at handling 5v logic remember that the output load is seen by the input device
3 | i know someone had long talks about solar sails early this year and late last year also about solar sailing not sure who captured it if possible i think it was one of the regulars who had most or all the data i think i started the latest round or the late last year round but the topic has been around here off and on for a year or two
1 | many thanks to those who replied to my appeal for info on a drive i have which is 3 5 600rpm i now have some information on how to modify this for use with a bbc b computer not only do you have to change the speed from 600 to 300 rpm tried that but also change 8 components in the rec play section to allow for the lower data rate 250kbit not 500kbit as it was designed for and also change the recording current to allow for the low data rate rev speed hopefully this should sort it all out not bad for 9 quid normally 32 quid and upwards the drive is a jvc mdp series drive

1 | aaahh a problem very near and dear to my heart in our case other monitors cause this problem the deflection coil of other monitors to be specific have also seen a monitor backed up to a fuse panel exhibit this problem this sounds like your problem since flourescent lites motors etc several 10s of feet away seem to me to be too far to cause it but the juice running to them must pass nearby your monitor fusebox on other side of wall maybe we started spec ing panasonic ct 1331y video monitors 3 switchable input lines vid aud s vhs on one 400 this stopped the wavy interference effect on the computer monitor next to it now on to your problem you need what is known as mu shielding very common in fact almost mandatory on electrostatic deflection type o scopes i talked to a ee prof he said get a coffee can cut both ends off mount around deflection coil of interfering monitor be careful to avoid all high voltage circuitry especially the thicker high voltage anode lead usually colored red if you kill yourself don t blame sue me use plastic or other non conducting stand offs and such to mount can now i would assume that what is good for keeping mag fields in is also good at keeping them out so hopefully this ll work by mounting shield on monitor being interfered with as well if not start shielding those other sources

2 | aspartame is the methyl ester of a dipeptide so a product of its hydrolysis is going to be methanol which can then be oxidized to formaldehyde the amounts of methanol formed from the ingestion of aspartame containing foods are completely in the metabolic noise since you re forming equally minute amounts of methanol from other components of food all the time in studies involving administration of high doses of the additive blood methanol levels were undetectable methanol is a poison only in quantities seen in human poisonings say 5ml and above this is a consequence of its oxidation to formaldehyde and formic acid two quite reactive compounds which at high enough levels can damage tissues like the retina and kidney because at such high doses the body s detoxification system is overwhelmed interestingly one treatment for early methanol poisoning is to get the person drunk on ethyl alcohol vodka or an equivalent that s because ethanol is metabolized preferentially over methanol by the enzymes in the liver if the methanol stays as methanol and isn t metabolized to formaldehyde it is actually relatively non toxic
2 | i think the question is what is extra scientific about this it has been a long time since anyone has proposed restrictions on where one comes up with ideas in order for them to be considered legitimate hypotheses the point in short is this hypotheses and speculation in science may come from wild flights of fancy daydreams ancient traditions modern quackery or anywhere else

yamada yscvax ysc go jp us planetary missions mariner venus mars mercury flybys and orbiters mariner 1 the first u s attempt to send a spacecraft to venus failed minutes after launch in 1962 the guidance instructions from the ground stopped reaching the rocket due to a problem with its antenna so the onboard computer took control however there turned out to be a bug in the guidance software and the rocket promptly went off course so the range safety officer destroyed it although the bug is sometimes claimed to have been an incorrect fortran do statement it was actually a transcription error in which the bar indicating smoothing was omitted from the expression r dot bar sub n nth smoothed value of derivative of radius this error led the software to treat normal minor variations of velocity as if they were serious leading to incorrect compensation mariner 2 became the first successful probe to flyby venus in december of 1962 and it returned information which confirmed that venus is a very hot 800 degrees fahrenheit now revised to 900 degrees f world with a cloud covered atmosphere composed primarily of carbon dioxide sulfuric acid was later confirmed in 1978 mariner 3 launched on november 5 1964 was lost when its protective shroud failed to eject as the craft was placed into interplanetary space unable to collect the sun s energy for power from its solar panels the probe soon died when its batteries ran out and is now in solar orbit it was intended for a mars flyby with mariner 4 mariner 4 the sister probe to mariner 3 did reach mars in 1965 and took the first close up images of the martian surface 22 in all as it flew by the planet the probe found a cratered world with an atmosphere much thinner than previously thought many scientists concluded from this preliminary scan that mars was a dead world in both the geological and biological sense mariner 5 was sent to venus in 1967 it reconfirmed the data on that planet collected five years earlier by mariner 2 plus the information that venus atmospheric pressure at its surface is at least 90 times that of earth s or the equivalent of being 3 300 feet under the surface of an ocean mariner 6 and 7 were sent to mars in 1969 and expanded upon the work done by mariner 4 four years earlier however they failed to take away the concept of mars as a dead planet first made from the basic measurements of mariner 4 mariner 8 ended up in the atlantic ocean in 1971 when the rocket launcher autopilot failed mariner 9 the sister probe to mariner 8 became the first craft to orbit mars in 1971 it returned information on the red planet that no other probe had done before revealing huge volcanoes on the martian surface as well as giant canyon systems and evidence that water once flowed across the planet the probe also took the first detailed closeup images of mars two small moons phobos and deimos mariner 10 used venus as a gravity assist to mercury in 1974 the probe did return the first close up images of the venusian atmosphere in ultraviolet revealing previously unseen details in the cloud cover plus the fact that the entire cloud system circles the planet in four earth days mariner 10 eventually made three flybys of mercury from 1974 to 1975 before running out of attitude control gas the probe revealed mercury as a heavily cratered world with a mass much greater than thought this would seem to indicate that mercury has an iron core which makes up 75 percent of the entire planet pioneer moon sun venus jupiter and saturn flybys and orbiters pioneer 1 through 3 failed to meet their main objective to photograph the moon close up but they did reach far enough into space to provide new information on the area between earth and the moon including new data on the van allen radiation belts circling earth all three craft had failures with their rocket launchers pioneer 1 was launched on october 11 1958 pioneer 2 on november 8 and pioneer 3 on december 6 pioneer 4 was a moon probe which missed the moon and became the first u s spacecraft to orbit the sun in 1959 pioneer 5 was originally designed to flyby venus but the mission was scaled down and it instead studied the interplanetary environment between venus and earth out to 36 2 million kilometers in 1960 a record until mariner 2 pioneer 6 through 9 were placed into solar orbit from 1965 to 1968 pioneer 6 7 and 8 are still transmitting information at this time pioneer e would have been number 10 suffered a launch failure in 1969 pioneer 10 became the first spacecraft to flyby jupiter in 1973 pioneer 11 followed it in 1974 and then went on to become the first probe to study saturn in 1979 both vehicles should continue to function through 1995 and are heading off into interstellar space the first craft ever to do so pioneer venus 1 1978 also known as pioneer venus orbiter or pioneer 12 burned up in the venusian atmosphere on october 8 1992 pvo made the first radar studies of the planet s surface via probe pioneer venus 2 also known as pioneer 13 sent four small probes into the atmosphere in december of 1978 the main spacecraft bus burned up high in the atmosphere while the four probes descended by parachute towards the surface though none were expected to survive to the surface the day probe did make it and transmitted for 67 5 minutes on the ground before its batteries failed ranger lunar lander and impact missions ranger 1 and 2 were test probes for the ranger lunar impact series they were meant for high earth orbit testing in 1961 but rocket problems left them in useless low orbits which quickly decayed ranger 3 launched on january 26 1962 was intended to land an instrument capsule on the surface of the moon but problems during the launch caused the probe to miss the moon and head into solar orbit ranger 3 did try to take some images of the moon as it flew by but the camera was unfortunately aimed at deep space during the attempt ranger 4 launched april 23 1962 had the same purpose as ranger 3 but suffered technical problems enroute and crashed on the lunar farside the first u s probe to reach the moon albeit without returning data ranger 5 launched october 18 1962 and similar to ranger 3 and 4 lost all solar panel and battery power enroute and eventually missed the moon and drifted off into solar orbit ranger 6 through 9 had more modified lunar missions they were to send back live images of the lunar surface as they headed towards an impact with the moon ranger 6 failed this objective in 1964 when its cameras did not operate ranger 7 through 9 performed well becoming the first u s lunar probes to return thousands of lunar images through 1965 lunar orbiter lunar surface photography lunar orbiter 1 through 5 were designed to orbit the moon and image various sites being studied as landing areas for the manned apollo missions of 1969 1972 the probes also contributed greatly to our understanding of lunar surface features particularly the lunar farside all five probes of the series launched from 1966 to 1967 were essentially successful in their missions they were the first u s probes to orbit the moon all los were eventually crashed into the lunar surface to avoid interference with the manned apollo missions surveyor lunar soft landers the surveyor series were designed primarily to see if an apollo lunar module could land on the surface of the moon without sinking into the soil before this time it was feared by some that the moon was covered in great layers of dust which would not support a heavy landing vehicle surveyor was successful in proving that the lunar surface was strong enough to hold up a spacecraft from 1966 to 1968 only surveyor 2 and 4 were unsuccessful missions the rest became the first u s probes to soft land on the moon taking thousands of images and scooping the soil for analysis apollo 12 landed 600 feet from surveyor 3 in 1969 and returned parts of the craft to earth surveyor 7 the last of the series was a purely scientific mission which explored the tycho crater region in 1968 viking mars orbiters and landers viking 1 was launched from cape canaveral florida on august 20 1975 on a titan 3e centaur d1 rocket the probe went into martian orbit on june 19 1976 and the lander set down on the western slopes of chryse planitia on july 20 1976 it soon began its programmed search for martian micro organisms there is still debate as to whether the probes found life there or not and sent back incredible color panoramas of its surroundings one thing scientists learned was that mars sky was pinkish in color not dark blue as they originally thought the sky is pink due to sunlight reflecting off the reddish dust particles in the thin atmosphere the lander set down among a field of red sand and boulders stretching out as far as its cameras could image the viking 1 orbiter kept functioning until august 7 1980 when it ran out of attitude control propellant the lander was switched into a weather reporting mode where it had been hoped it would keep functioning through 1994 but after november 13 1982 an errant command had been sent to the lander accidentally telling it to shut down until further orders communication was never regained again despite the engineers efforts through may of 1983 an interesting side note viking 1 s lander has been designated the thomas a mutch memorial station in honor of the late leader of the lander imaging team the national air and space museum in washington d c is entrusted with the safekeeping of the mutch station plaque until it can be attached to the lander by a manned expedition viking 2 was launched on september 9 1975 and arrived in martian orbit on august 7 1976 the lander touched down on september 3 1976 in utopia planitia it accomplished essentially the same tasks as its sister lander with the exception that its seisometer worked recording one marsquake the orbiter had a series of attitude control gas leaks in 1978 which prompted it being shut down that july the lander was shut down on april 12 1980 the orbits of both viking orbiters should decay around 2025 voyager outer planet flybys voyager 1 was launched september 5 1977 and flew past jupiter on march 5 1979 and by saturn on november 13 1980 voyager 2 was launched august 20 1977 before voyager 1 and flew by jupiter on august 7 1979 by saturn on august 26 1981 by uranus on january 24 1986 and by neptune on august 8 1989 voyager 2 took advantage of a rare once every 189 years alignment to slingshot its way from outer planet to outer planet voyager 1 could in principle have headed towards pluto but jpl opted for the sure thing of a titan close up between the two probes our knowledge of the 4 giant planets their satellites and their rings has become immense voyager 1 2 discovered that jupiter has complicated atmospheric dynamics lightning and aurorae three new satellites were discovered two of the major surprises were that jupiter has rings and that io has active sulfurous volcanoes with major effects on the jovian magnetosphere when the two probes reached saturn they discovered over 1000 ringlets and 7 satellites including the predicted shepherd satellites that keep the rings stable the weather was tame compared with jupiter massive jet streams with minimal variance a 33 year great white spot band cycle is known titan s atmosphere was smoggy mimas appearance was startling one massive impact crater gave it the death star appearance the big surprise here was the stranger aspects of the rings braids kinks and spokes were both unexpected and difficult to explain voyager 2 thanks to heroic engineering and programming efforts continued the mission to uranus and neptune uranus itself was highly monochromatic in appearance one oddity was that its magnetic axis was found to be highly skewed from the already completely skewed rotational axis giving uranus a peculiar magnetosphere icy channels were found on ariel and miranda was a bizarre patchwork of different terrains 10 satellites and one more ring were discovered in contrast to uranus neptune was found to have rather active weather including numerous cloud features the ring arcs turned out to be bright patches on one ring two other rings and 6 other satellites were discovered neptune s magnetic axis was also skewed triton had a canteloupe appearance and geysers what s liquid at 38k the two voyagers are expected to last for about two more decades their on target journeying gives negative evidence about possible planets beyond pluto their next major scientific discovery should be the location of the heliopause soviet planetary missions since there have been so many soviet probes to the moon venus and mars i will highlight only the primary missions soviet lunar probes luna 1 lunar impact attempt in 1959 missed moon and became first craft in solar orbit luna 2 first craft to impact on lunar surface in 1959 luna 3 took first images of lunar farside in 1959 zond 3 took first images of lunar farside in 1965 since luna 3 was also a test for future mars missions luna 9 first probe to soft land on the moon in 1966 returned images from surface luna 10 first probe to orbit the moon in 1966 luna 13 second successful soviet lunar soft landing mission in 1966 zond 5 first successful circumlunar craft zond 6 through 8 accomplished similar missions through 1970 the probes were unmanned tests of a manned orbiting soyuz type lunar vehicle luna 16 first probe to land on moon and return samples of lunar soil to earth in 1970 luna 20 accomplished similar mission in 1972 luna 17 delivered the first unmanned lunar rover to the moon s surface lunokhod 1 in 1970 a similar feat was accomplished with luna 21 lunokhod 2 in 1973 luna 24 last soviet lunar mission to date returned soil samples in 1976 soviet venus probes venera 1 first acknowledged attempt at venus mission transmissions lost enroute in 1961 venera 2 attempt to image venus during flyby mission in tandem with venera 3 probe ceased transmitting just before encounter in february of 1966 no images were returned venera 3 attempt to place a lander capsule on venusian surface transmissions ceased just before encounter and entire probe became the first craft to impact on another planet in 1966 venera 4 first probe to successfully return data while descending through venusian atmosphere crushed by air pressure before reaching surface in 1967 venera 5 and 6 mission profiles similar in 1969 venera 7 first probe to return data from the surface of another planet in 1970 venera 8 accomplished a more detailed mission in 1972 venera 9 sent first image of venusian surface in 1975 was also the first probe to orbit venus venera 10 accomplished similar mission venera 13 returned first color images of venusian surface in 1982 venera 14 accomplished similar mission venera 15 accomplished radar mapping with venera 16 of sections of planet s surface in 1983 more detailed than pvo vega 1 accomplished with vega 2 first balloon probes of venusian atmosphere in 1985 including two landers flyby buses went on to become first spacecraft to study comet halley close up in march of 1986 soviet mars probes mars 1 first acknowledged mars probe in 1962 transmissions ceased enroute the following year zond 2 first possible attempt to place a lander capsule on martian surface probe signals ceased enroute in 1965 mars 2 first soviet mars probe to land albeit crash on martian surface orbiter section first soviet probe to circle the red planet in 1971 mars 3 first successful soft landing on martian surface but lander signals ceased after 90 seconds in 1971 mars 4 attempt at orbiting mars in 1974 braking rockets failed to fire probe went on into solar orbit mars 5 first fully successful soviet mars mission orbiting mars in 1974 returned images of martian surface comparable to u s probe mariner 9 mars 6 landing attempt in 1974 lander crashed into the surface mars 7 lander missed mars completely in 1974 went into a solar orbit with its flyby bus phobos 1 first attempt to land probes on surface of mars largest moon phobos probe failed enroute in 1988 due to human computer error phobos 2 attempt to land probes on martian moon phobos the probe did enter mars orbit in early 1989 but signals ceased one week before scheduled phobos landing while there has been talk of soviet jupiter saturn and even interstellar probes within the next thirty years no major steps have yet been taken with these projects more intensive studies of the moon mars venus and various comets have been planned for the 1990s and a mercury mission to orbit and land probes on the tiny world has been planned for 2003 how the many changes in the former soviet union now the commonwealth of independent states will affect the future of their space program remains to be seen japanese planetary missions sakigake ms t5 was launched from the kagoshima space center by isas on january 8 1985 and approached halley s comet within about 7 million km on march 11 1986 the spacecraft is carrying three instru ments to measure interplanetary magnetic field plasma waves solar wind all of which work normally now so isas made an earth swingby by sakigake on january 8 1992 into an orbit similar to the earth s the closest approach was at 23h08m47s jst utc 9h on january 8 1992 the geocentric distance was 88 997 km this is the first planet swingby for a japanese spacecraft during the approach sakigake observed the geotail some geotail passages will be scheduled in some years hence the second earth swingby will be on june 14 1993 at 40 re earth s radius and the third october 28 1994 at 86 re hiten a small lunar probe was launched into earth orbit on january 24 1990 the spacecraft was then known as muses a but was renamed to hiten once in orbit the 430 lb probe looped out from earth and made its first lunary flyby on march 19 where it dropped off its 26 lb midget satellite hagoromo japan at this point became the third nation to orbit a satellite around the moon joining the unites states and ussr the smaller spacecraft hagoromo remained in orbit around the moon an apparently broken transistor radio caused the japanese space scientists to lose track of it hagoromo s rocket motor fired on schedule on march 19 but the spacecraft s tracking transmitter failed immediately the rocket firing of hagoromo was optically confirmed using the schmidt camera 105 cm f3 1 at the kiso observatory in japan hiten made multiple lunar flybys at approximately monthly intervals and performed aerobraking experiments using the earth s atmosphere hiten made a close approach to the moon at 22 33 jst utc 9h on february 15 1992 at the height of 423 km from the moon s surface 35 3n 9 7e and fired its propulsion system for about ten minutes to put the craft into lunar orbit the following is the orbital calculation results after the approach apoapsis altitude about 49 400 km periapsis altitude about 9 600 km inclination 34 7 deg to ecliptic plane period 4 7 days planetary mission references i also recommend reading the following works categorized in three groups general overviews specific books on particular space missions and periodical sources on space probes this list is by no means complete it is primarily designed to give you places to start your research through generally available works on the subject if anyone can add pertinent works to the list it would be greatly appreciated though naturally i recommend all the books listed below i think it would be best if you started out with the general overview books in order to give you a clear idea of the history of space exploration in this area i also recommend that you pick up some good up to date general works on astronomy and the sol system to give you some extra background most of these books and periodicals can be found in any good public and university library some of the more recently published works can also be purchased in and or ordered through any good mass market bookstore general overviews in alphabetical order by author j kelly beatty et al the new solar system 1990 merton e davies and bruce c murray

the probes are found by intelligences in interstellar space as well as the probes and planetary mission objectives themselves other works and periodicals nasa has published very detailed and technical books on every space probe mission it has launched good university libraries will carry these books and they are easily found simply by knowing which mission you wish to read about i recommend these works after you first study some of the books listed above some periodicals i recommend for reading on space probes are national geographic which has written articles on the pioneer probes to earth s moon luna and the jovian planets jupiter and saturn the ranger surveyor lunar orbiter and apollo missions to luna the mariner missions to mercury venus and mars the viking probes to mars and the voyager missions to jupiter saturn uranus and neptune more details on american soviet european and japanese probe missions can be found in sky and telescope astronomy science nature and scientific american magazines time newsweek and various major newspapers can supply not only general information on certain missions but also show you what else was going on with earth at the time events were unfolding if that is of interest to you space missions are affected by numerous political economic and climatic factors as you probably know depending on just how far your interest in space probes will go you might also wish to join the planetary society one of the largest space groups in the world dedicated to planetary exploration their periodical the planetary report details the latest space probe missions write to the planetary society 65 north catalina avenue pasadena california 91106 usa good luck with your studies in this area of space exploration i personally find planetary missions to be one of the more exciting areas in this field and the benefits human society has and will receive from it are incredible with many yet to be realized larry klaes klaes verga enet dec com

2 | yes absolutely though i d make the observation in a more general sense of all observations are made by human beings and therefore made with various biases but here your message leaves talk of hypothesis and gets back once again to equating the business of science with the end result the gizmo produced my point isn t so much whether or not you have a novel paradigm but how you come about developing it perhaps you d admit that this is an oversimplification on your part the topic of the philosophy of science is made for them i m making them too but i think that it also summarizes popular misconceptions of science and the business of doing science biomedical research doesn t make any basic assumptions that aren t the same as any other discipline of scientific research that is that you make empirical observations form an hypothesis and test it modern medicine has much more to do with biochemistry than the old newtonian model of the world and i doubt that many psychologists would appreciate being put outside this empirical world view psychology also has more to do with biochemistry than spoon bending oversimplified of course but a good example this is an empirical observa tion it was then tested though perhaps not by aristotle and eventually found wanting in the meantime some folk will have continued to believe in the spontaneous generation of animal life there s nothing at all surprising about this it s the way the gathering of knowledge works there are probably more than a few things in my own discipline of molecular biology that will be found to be totally off base even idiotic to someone in the future these future people won t have come to these relevations because they had suddenly gone all zen like and had a vision in an lsd trip someone will have thought of something new and tested it this is the bit that people who seem to relish misrepresenting science and research can t seem to wrap their minds around science is a creative process what i think of as factual and good research can be totally turned on its head tommorrow by new results and theories

2 | rutin is a bioflavonoid compounds found among other places in the rinds of citrus fruits these have been popular especially in europe to treat capillary fragility and seemingly in even more extreme cases a few months ago a friend was visiting from italy and he said that he d had hemorrhoids but his pharmacist friend sold him some pills incredulously i asked to look at them and sure enough these contained rutin as the active ingredient i probably destroyed the placebo effect from my skeptical sputtering i have no idea how he s doing hemorrhoid wise these days the studies which attempted to look at the effect of these compounds in human disease and nutrition were never very well controlled so the reports of positive results with them is mostly anecdotal this stuff is pretty much non toxic and probably inexpensive so there s little risk of trying it but i wouldn t expect much of a result
3 | i might suggest giving the management some more mumble time by asking the very leading question in two or three parts what are your long term expectations of space market what projects specifically are they funding by internal funds and at what levels and what competition do you expect in this area this last point is always worth hitting upper management with gently if you want them to think and as hard as you can if you have a good case that there really is competion
3 | in spite of my great respect for the people you speak of i think their cost estimates are a bit over optimistic if nothing else a working ssto is at least as complex as a large airliner and has a smaller experience base it therefore seems that ssto development should cost at least as much as a typical airliner development that puts it in the 3g to 5g range true it and the contest would result in a much larger market but i don t think it would be enough to attract the investors given the risks involved if you could gurantee the ssto costs and gurantee that it captures 100 of the available launch market then i think you could do it allen

3 | background the orion spacedrive was a theoretical concept it would be a drive using thermonuclear explosions to drive a spacecraft the idea was that you d detonate devices with somewhere from one to ten megatons yield behind a pusher plate attached to the main spacecraft the shock wave from the explosions would transfer momentum to the ship now in an atmosphere i can see this the energy of the explosion heats the atmosphere which expands explosively and slams a shock wave into the pusher plate but in a vacuum only two things i can see are going to hit the plate fission fusion products barium krypton helium neutrons evaporated bomb casing and electromagnetic radiation gammas mostly some light heat from irradiated fission products would this work i can t see the em radiation impelling very much momentum especially given the mass of the pusher plate and it seems to me you re going to get more momentum transfer throwing the bombs out the back of the ship than you get from detonating them once they re there i must be missing something would someone enlighten me via email thanks jim

2 | one thing that i haven t seen in this thread is a discussion of the relation between ibd inflammation and the profile of ingested fatty acids fas i was diagnosed last may w crohn s of the terminal ileum when i got out of the hospital i read up on it a bit and came across several studies investigating the role of epa an essentially fa in reducing inflammation the evidence was mixed many of these studies are discussed in inflammatory bowel disease macdermott stenson 1992 but if i recall correctly there were some methodological bones to be picked with the studies both the ones w pos and w neg results in the studies patients were given epa a few grams day for most of the studies but if i recall correctly there was no restriction of the _other_ fas that the patients could consume from the informed layperson s perspective this seems mistaken if lots of n 6 fas are consumed along with the epa then the ratio of bad prostanoid products to good prostanoid products could still be fairly bad isn t this ratio the issue what s the view of the gastro community on epa these days epa supplements along with a fairly severe restriction of other fas appear to have helped me significantly though it could just be the low absolute amount of fat i eat 8 10 calories

2 | i experienced a sudden numbness in my left arm this morning just after i completed my 4th set of deep squats today was my weight training day and i was just beginning my routine all of a sudden at the end of the 4th set my arm felt like it had gone to sleep it was cold turned pale and lost 60 of its strength the weight i used for squats wasn t that heavy i was working hard but not at 100 effort i waited for a few minutes trying to shake the arm back to life and then continued with chest exercises flyes with lighter dumbells than i normally use but i dropped the left dumbell during the first set and experienced continued arm weakness into the second so i quit training and decided not to do my usual hour on the ski machine either i ll take it easy for the rest of the day my arm is still somewhat numb and significantly weaker than normal my hand still tingles a bit down to the thumb color has returned to normal and it is no longer cold horrid thoughts of chunks of plaque blocking a major artery course through my brain i m 34 vegetarian and pretty fit from my daily exercise regimen so that can t be it could a pinched nerve from the bar cause these symptoms i hope has this happened to anyone else nothing like this has ever happened to me before does it come with age thanks tom

1 | fortunately wire wrapping is a better wiring technique than most at high frequencies cray computers up to the x mp at least all had wirewrapped backplanes wirewrap gets into trouble at much higher frequencies than any ttl can handle the increase of wiring capacitance is not really relevant you have to use transmission line techniques and the capacitance is no problem hand powered is a terrible choice imho unless you are a field maintenance person who will do maybe a dozen connections at a time your hands will cramp battery powered wire wrap guns are available in the 150 range and so are the little twiddle stick manual types 15 for a modest project of a couple hundred connections i d prefer to borrow a professional ac unit or a pneumatic one

1 | stuff deleted good gravy decibels are all ratios the question that remains in any ratio is the reference unit used sometimes this will be a reference power such as 1 milliwatt given a certain circuit impedance which should also be included in the fine print or known like 50 ohms in an rf circuit of that impedance leading to an accepted notation of dbm maybe it might be dbv disregarding the impedance of the circuit and power developed using 1 volt as reference amplitude rather than reference power or it might have an arbitrary or omitted reference that is not included in the notation leading to just plain db so look at it this way db has an implied reference while notation such as dbm has an explicit reference for power db 10 log p measured p reference for amplitude db 20 log a measured a reference b is for bel which is a standard term for a log ratio to the base 10 named after alexander graham bell a deci bel is 1 10 of a bel it has nothing to do with the bell telephone company except for the common founder s name the small d large b is per si notation convention i don t know anyone that s been crucified for messing it up common references for audio are 0 dbm 1 milliwatt across 600 ohms 0 dbv 1 volt 0 vu a zero on the vu meter 4 dbm pro gear line level 0 vu 10dbv consumer gear line level often times a power amp vu meter will be aligned using the rated power of the amp as the 0 db point it is all done to whatever reference is reasonable for the application or moment note that in a circuit with a given and maybe unknown linear impedance if the amplitude goes up so many decibels the power will also increase the same amount this proof can be done with the above two identities and ohm s law dave medin phone 205 730 3169 w ssd networking 205 837 1174 h intergraph corp m s gd3004 internet dtmedin catbyte b30 ingr com huntsville al 35894 uucp uunet ingr b30 catbyte dtmedin everywhere you look at least around my office

2 | not to drag this out anymore but many veterinarians feel that lyme disease in dogs is so easy to treat that in an endemic area they often just give the appropriate antibiotics to dogs presenting with lameness swollen joints fever a recent paper march 1993 has finally established that lyme disease in dogs can be reproduced in a controlled experimentaly setting this has been an ellusive matter for researchers and is one of the fundamental requirements for many to acknowledge an agent as being causitive of a particular disease up to now only the vaccine manufacturer has been able to prove that the disease exists this paper is noteworthy in two other regards 1 none of the animals they infected were treated in any way the dogs had episodes of lameness during a 6 8 week period which occurred 2 5 months after exposure after this period none showed any further clinical signs up to the 17 month observation period of the study so these are proven clinically sick lyme patients showing spontaneous recovery without the benefit of drug treatment of course observations longer than 17 months will be necessary to be sure the disease doesn t have the same chronicity that some see in humans 2 the addendum to the paper calls into question the techniques used by the vaccine manufacturer to validate the vaccine of course they want the world to use the model they developed in order to test vaccine efficacy anyway maybe we will see some independent scientifically sound evaluations of this vaccine in the next year or so

2 | i am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway about five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms after the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain at this time her doctor suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue while attending one of her therapy sessions while her arm was being manipulated some damage occured nerve which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly controlled by tylenol 3s and some loss of use of the arm palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement with great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm this was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased the doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed tylenol 3 and soon morphine to relieve the pain she has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term my questions are has anyone has heard of similar cases and what if anything was done to reduce the levels of pain are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated please respond by email because i do not always get chance to read this group if anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup that i should be posting this to it would also be appreciated
3 | i ve seen a film of it my memory may be faulty but as i remember it the vehicle was slightly over a meter long with a thick baseplate 30 40 cm in diameter i think the narrative said it was propelled by dynamite sticks there were four detonations within about 2 s the second coming after about 2 m of flight in max altitude seemed to be on the order of 50 m but that is hard to judge

2 | there s a lot of evidence it just hasn t been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used for example dr ivker who wrote the book sinus survival always gives before any other treatment a systemic anti fungal such as nizoral to his new patients if they ve been on braod spectrum anti biotics 4 or more times in the last two years he s kept a record of the results and for over 2000 patients found that over 90 of his patients get significant relief of allergic sinus symptoms of course this is only the beginning for his program in my case as i reported a few weeks ago i was developing the classic symptoms outlined in the yeast connection i agree it is a poorly written book e g extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which i never had before started in november within one week of full dosage of sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared i can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes i m also greatly improved in other areas as well of course i have allergy symptoms etc i am especially allergic to molds yeasts etc it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you don t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people in my case it was sinus since that s the center of my allergic response of course the 60 000 question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i was from over 5 years of antibiotics nutritionally deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies etc can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti fungals still have to be careful however so there s no reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasons btw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect you ll find a lot of people who are on nystatin all the time in summary i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road but methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven t been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients if anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection i cannot guarantee their safety for their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as far as i am concerned jon noring charter member infj club

2 | am i justified in being pissed off at this doctor last saturday evening my 6 year old son cut his finger badly with a knife i took him to a local urgent and general care clinic at 5 50 pm the clinic was open till 6 00 pm the receptionist went to the back and told the doctor that we were there and came back and told us the doctor would not see us because she had someplace to go at 6 00 and did not want to be delayed here during the next few minutes in response to my questions with several trips to the back room the receptionist told me the doctor was doing paperwork in the back the doctor would not even look at his finger to advise us on going to the emergency room the doctor would not even speak to me she would not tell me the doctor s name or her own name when asked who is in charge of the clinic she said i don t know i realize that a private clinic is not the same as an emergency room but i was quite angry at being turned away because the doctor did not want to be bothered my son did get three stitches at the emergency room speaking as a physician who works in an urgent care center the above behavior is completely inappropriate if a patient who requires extensive care shows up at the last minute we always see them and give them appropriate care it is reasonable for a clinic to refuse to see patients outside of its posted hours but what you describe is misbehavior ask to speak to the clinic director and complain whatever their attitude they have nothing to gain from angering patients

2 | flights of fancy and other irrational approaches are common the crucial thing is not to sit around just having fantasies they aren t of any use unless they make you do some experiments i ve known a lot of scientists whose fantasies lead them on to creative work usually they won t admit out loud what the fantasy was prior to the consumption of a few beers simple example warren jelinek noticed an extremely heavy band on a dna electrophoresis gel of human alu fragments he got very excited hoping that he d seen some essential part of the control mechanism for eukaryotic genes this fantasy led him to sequence samples of the band and carry out binding assays the result was a well conserved 400 or so bp sequence that occurs about 500 000 times in the human genome unfortunately for warren s fantasy it turns out to be a transposon that is present in so many copies because it replicates itself and copies itself back into the genome on the other hand the characteristics of transposons were much elucidated the necessity of a cellular reverse transcriptase was recognized and the standard method of recognizing human dna was created other species have different sets of transposons fortunately for me warren and i used to eat dinner at t g i fridays all the time i m not sure that it s random but there is no known rational mechanism for generating a rich set of interesting hypotheses if you are really working in an unknown area it is unlikely that you will have much sense of what might or might not be true under those circumstances the best thing to do is just follow whatever instincts you have if they are wrong you will find out soon enough but at least you will find out _something_ if you try to do experiments at random with no prior conceptions at all in mind you will probably get nowhere unfortunately the critical function does sometimes become hostage to non rational forces then we get varieties of pathological science lysenko mirsky s opposition to dna as gene cold fusion and so forth i don t agree that this follows in fact this is _exactly_ the point at which i disagree with feyerabend it is a most important part of the culture of science that one keeps one s jealousies out of the refereeing process failures there are aplenty but on the whole things work out another point there are a couple of senses of the phrase experimental design i d say that the less rational part is in experimental _choice_ not design alexander fleming proc royal soc 1922 chose to look for bacteriophage in his own mucus for strange reasons phage had previously been found in locust diarrhea fleming probably thought runny bottom runny nose what the hell it s worth a try but his method of looking for phage was well designed to detect anything phage like in fact he found lysozyme it is not clear to me what you mean by rational vs irrational perhaps you can give a few examples of surprising experiments that were tried out for perfectly rational reasons or interesting new theories that were first advanced from logical grounds the main examples i can think of are from modern high energy physics which is not typical of science as a whole

1 | thanks for the resposes as they were all good ideas and i am looking at using a couple of the ideas i recieved in the mail today the spec sheets on the mil spec version of exar s xr 2240 timer counter chip it is stable down to 50 c and sucks very little power they show an application for a ultra long time delay up to several years depending on the rc time constant in this application they have two of them cascaded together the reset and trigger pins of both chips are tied together and the timebase of the second chip is disabled in this configuration the output is high when the system is reset when triggered the output goes low and stays that way for a total of 65 536 x the timing cycle of the first chip the total timing cycle of the two chips can be programmed from to 256 x r x c to 65 536 x r x c in 256 steps by selecting any combination of the counter outputs to the timer output the beauty of it is the timebase chip would only have to have a 100uf timing cap and a 391k resistor for 39 1 seconds per timing cycle so i can get a maximum of 2 562 457 6 seconds between timing cycles 39 1 x 65 536 or about 29 days of course that s much more than i need 14 days but the counter allows for 256 binary steps that can be selected for the output for the pellet puker after the first 14 days and it trips it would reset its self for the next 14 day timing cycle and so forth power is still a problem though a few ideas that you suggested was to bury the electronics in a hole dug in the snow as an insulator and put the pellet puker up on a tower above the estimated snow fall with a solar panel on it to keep a charge on a lithium battery pack i like that idea this thing has to work for at least six weeks for three samples and the gas valves are 12 volts to spit the pellets out onto the snow anyway i ordered the xr 2240 s to see what i can do with them should be interesting as long as i m not the one that has to go digging up the pellets in the middle of antartica freezing my buns off thanks again everyone

2 | purists often distinguish between true clubbing and pseudo clubbing the difference being that with true clubbing the angle of the nail when viewed from the side is constantly negative when proceeding distally towards the fingertip with pseudo clubbing the angle is initially positive then negative which is the normal situation real internists can talk for hours about clubbing i m limited to a couple of minutes whether this distinction has anything to do with reality is entirely unclear but it is one of those things that internists love to paw over during rounds supposedly only true clubbing is associated with disease the problem is that the list of diseases associated with clubbing is quite long and includes both congenital conditions and acquired disease since many of these diseases are associated with cardiopulmonary problems leading to right to left shunts and chronic hypoxemia it is very reasonable to get a chest xray however many of the congenital abnormalities would only be diagnosed with a cardiac catheterization the cause of clubbing is unclear but presumably relates to some factor causing blood vessels in the distal fingertip to dilate abnormally clubbing is one of those things from an examination which is a tipoff to do more extensive examination often however the cause of the clubbing is quite apparent

tools to this rich and complex domain material covered will include structural and informational molecules the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material the central dogma of gene expression and selected other topics in the area of structure function and regulation as relates to current computational approaches dr noordewier has appointments in both computer science and biology at rutgers and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biology 12 00 2 45pm introduction to artificial intelligence for biologists dr richard lathrop mit arris corp an overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented as it relates to actual and potential biological applications fundamental techniques symbolic programming languages and notions of search will be discussed as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail such as knowledge representation inference and machine learning the intended audience includes biologists with some computational background but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence dr lathrop co developer of ariadne and related technologies has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industry 3 00 5 45pm neural networks statistics and information theory in biological sequence analysis dr alan lapedes los alamos national laboratory this tutorial will cover the most rapidly expanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and information theoretic views of sequence data dr lapedes of the theoretical division at los alamos has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domain 3 00 5 45pm genetic algorithms and genetic programming prof john koza stanford university the genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highly non linear multi dimensional optimization problems was originally inspired by a biological metaphor this tutorial will cover both the biological motivations and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm genetic programming an extension well suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem will also be addressed particular attention will be paid to biological applications and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods dr koza a consulting professor of computer science at stanford has taught this subject since 1988 and is the author of a standard text in the field 3 00 5 45pm linguistic methods in sequence analysis prof david searls university of pennsylvania shmuel pietrokovski weizmann institute approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence these involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness dr searls who holds research faculty appointments in both genetics and computer science at penn represents the branch of this field that considers higher order syntactic approaches to sequence data while shmuel pietrokovski has studied and published with prof edward trifinov in the area of word

1 | this is definitely the wrong newsgroup for this but never mind any machine powered by heat motor steam or gasturbine steamengine thermoelement etc work the better the bigger the temperature difference between input and output is because you never get all thermic energy out of the powering medium steam burning gaz etc you have to eliminate the rest of the energy to keep the efficency high a thermal electric power plant coal oil or atomic power works just the same way you heat water steam to power the turbine and generators because you don t get the whole energy out of the steam efficency is never 100 you have to cool down this steam again by something else most power plants use cooling towers for this purpose some type of mega refrigerator others use water of a river ecologically not unobjectionable got it cheers robert hb9nby

3 | if i m not mistaken this is the usual sort of precaution against loss of communications that timer is counting down continuously if it ever hits zero that means galileo hasn t heard from earth in a suspiciously long time and it may be galileo s fault so it s time to go into a fallback mode that minimizes chances of spacecraft damage and maximizes chances of restoring contact i don t know exactly what all galileo does in such a situation but a common example is to switch receivers on the theory that maybe the one you re listening with has died
2 | i think that lee lady and i are talking at cross purposes above lady seems concerned with the contrast between great science that makes big advances in our knowledge and mediocre science that makes smaller steps in most of this thread i have been concerned with the difference between what is science and what is not lee lady is correct when she asserts that the difference between einstein and the average post doc physicist is the quality of their thought but what is the difference between einstein and a genius who would be a great scientist but whose great thoughts are scientifically screwy some would give velikovsky or korzybski as examples if you don t like these choose your own i say it is the same as the difference between the mediocre physicist and the mediocre proponent of qi both einstein and the mediocre physcists have disciplined their work from the cumulative knowledge of how previous researchers went wrong both velikovsky and the mediocre proponent of qi have failed to do this let me approach this from a second direction when one is asked to review a paper for a journal or conference there are many kinds of criticism that one can make one kind of criticism is that the work is just wrong or misinformed another kind of criticism is that the work while technically correct is either not important or not interesting the first difference is the one that i have been pointing to the second difference is the one that lee lady seems to be discussing i have often pointed out that for homeopathy to be considered scientific what is needed is a test of its theoretical claims not just of some of its proposed remedies similarly i suspect that traditional chinese medicine has many remedies that work what it lacks as one example is any experiment that tests the presence of qi certainly a theoretical structure that makes sense is the goal in areas where we do not yet have this i see nothing wrong with forming and testing smaller hypotheses let s face it we cannot always wait for an einstein to come along and make everything clear for us sometimes those of us who are not einstein have to plug along and make small amounts of progress as best we can

1 | i ve got two lines coming into my apartment two different telephone numbers when i ordered the second line installed instead of bringing out another 4 wire bundle the telco just connected up to my yellow and black wires so i have one line on red green and the other on yellow black today i was monitoring the voltage on both lines i had a voltmeter across the red and green and read back 52 volts i then lifted up the receiver on my second line black yellow wires the voltage dropped to 31 volts on the first line red green wires i repeated this experiment with the second line monitoring black yellow and lifting the handset off the cradle on the red and green line it also dropped to 31 volts why is this i thought these were separate lines next i went to the 66 block and disconnected the blue and white lines coming in from the telco cable i then disconnected all the phones in my apartment and went back to the 66 block and did some resistance measurements both lines read open i ll appreciate any help on this is this considered normal guy urbina

2 | obviously it wouldn t be of much help to treat one problem by knowingly introducing another cancer mestastizes my imperfect understanding of the facts are that gonadal cancer is particularly dangerous in this regard i haven t done the research on it but i don t recall ever hearing of a case of cancer being transmitted by a blood transfusion probably just a common sense kind of arbitrary precaution transmissable diseases like malaria though are obviously another story
3 | unfortunately if you launch this from the us or are a us citizen you will need a launch permit from the office of commercial space transportation and i think it may be difficult to get a permit for an antisatellite weapon the threshold at which ocst licensing kicks in is roughly 100km the rules are actually phrased in more complex ways but that is the result

2 | these effects are a very real concern in conducting studies of new treatments researchers try to limit this kind of effect by performing studies that are blind in various ways some of these are o the subjects of the study do not know whether they receive a placebo or the test treatment i e whether they are in the control group or the test group o those administering the treatment do not know which subjects receive a placebo or the test treatment o those evaluating individual results do not know which subjects receive a placebo or the test treatment obviously at the point at which the data is analyzed one has to differentiate the test group from the control group but the analysis is quasi public the researcher describes it and presents the data on which it is based so that others can verify it it is worth noting that in biological studies where the subjects are animals such as mice there were many cases of skewed results because those who performed the study did not blind themselves it is not considered so important to make mice more ignorant than they already are though it is important that in all respects except the one tested the control and test groups are treated alike
3 | hi i m writing a science fiction script and i m looking for some answers to questions regarding the moon and earth my starting point is an impossible situation i checked with a professor at berkeley and his response was a very helpful can t happen if you enjoy playing with unusual ideas and are willing answer some questions please contact me via e mail jennise dgi com i get extremely annoyed when screen and tele plays ignore basic facts about computers that i m determined to be as scientifically accurate as i can sorry for being vague but i d like to protect my idea as much as i can until i m ready to sell it hopefully
3 | the european space agency has involvement with remote earth observation and i presume this includes surveillance optical etc so it s not just the us ussr ex who are in the game but what is the game what can be done with space observation the military functions of missile spotting troop spotting etc are well documented but what about anything else the biggest eg i can think of is to get a metal sensing sat over a paying country and scan their territory for precious metals more importantly if radar can spot water vapour clouds presumably a radar based sat will be capable of spotting rivers open water and underground water from space this would be a positive life saver for african or other drought affected countries implementing a clean water and irrigation program would be of imense benifit to such countries and should cut down mortalities considerably so how about it is there a charity or government agency that would pay for a third world country to have their minerals and water deposits mapped or is this still sci fi mail replies would be great thought for the day thermal energy needs water to make steam so sstick it in the ocean
2 | good grief again why the anger i must have really touched a raw nerve let s see i had symptoms that resisted all other treatments sporanox totally alleviated them within one week hmmm i must be psychotic yesss that s it my illness was all in my mind thanks steve for your correct diagnosis you must have a lot of experience being out there in trenches treating hundreds of patients a week thank you i m forever in your debt jon oops gotta run the men in white coats are ready to take me away haha to the happy home where i can go twiddle my thumbs basket weave and moan about my sinuses charter member infj club

3 | this might a real wierd idea or maybe not i have seen where people have blown up ballons then sprayed material into them that then drys and makes hard walls why not do the same thing for a space station fly up the docking rings and baloon materials and such blow up the baloons spin then around i know a problem in micro gravity let them dry cure harden and cut a hole for the docking attaching ring and bingo a space station of course the ballons would have to be foil covered or someother radiation protective covering heat shield and the material used to make the wals would have to meet the out gasing and other specs or atleast the paint covering of the inner wall would have to be human safe maybe a special congrete or maybe the same material as makes caplets but with some changes saw where someone instea dof water put beer in the caplet mixture got a mix that was just as strong as congret but easier to carry around and such sorry for any spelling errors i missed school today grin why musta space station be so difficult why must we have girders why be confined to earth based ideas lets think new ideas after all space is not earth why be limited by earth based ideas

2 | i got asked in sci med nutrition about vitamin c and oxalate production toxic kidney stone formation i decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones not long after i got into sci med i got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation i m going to state it again here but the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take b6 supplements read on to find out why i have my asbestos suit on now guys vitamin c will form oxalic acid but large doses are needed above 6 grams per day 1 review article nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on vitamin c int clin nutr rev 5 3 110 129 1985 but glycine also forms oxalic acid d amino acid oxidases for both glycine and vitamin c one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin c or glycine but to increase your intake of vitamin b6 2 control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones int urol nephrol 20 4 353 59 1988 200 to 500 mg of b6 each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the 18 month treatment program 3 the action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria clin sci 38 277 86 1970 patients receiving at least 150mg b6 each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels for gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activity b6 is required for transaminase activity which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination d amino acid oxidases for vitamin c the effect is quite different there are different pathways for vitamin c catabolism the pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have 17 to 40 of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid but this is highly variable and the vitamin c review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto 6 grams per day not too much vitamin c gets catabolized to form oxalic acid at very high doses of vitamin c above 10 grams per day more of the extra vitamin c more than 40 conversion can end up as oxalic acid in a very early study on vitamin c and oxalic production proc soc exp biol med 85 190 92 1954 intakes of 2 grams per day up to 9 grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from 38mg per day up to 178mg per day until 8 grams per day was reached the average excreted was increased by only 3 to 12mg per day 2 gram dose 4 gram dose 8 gram dose and 9gram dose 8 grams jumped it to 45mg over the average excretion before supplementation and 9 grams jumped it to 150 mg over the average before supplementation b6 is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body there are probably some enzymes that require vitamin b6 that we don t know about yet vitamin c catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires b6 differences in b6 levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin c challenge this is not the preferred route of catabolism increasing your intake of b6 would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin c supplements since the typical american diet is deficient in b6 some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium oxalate kidney stones is b6 deficiency especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut diets providing 0 to 130mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate urol int 35 309 15 1980 if 400mg was present each day there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion here are the high oxalate foods 1 beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea contain at least 25mg 100grams 2 beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanuts pepper sweet potatoe contain 10 to 25 mg 100grams if the threshold is 130mg per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection a recent n eng j med article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all if you also increase your intake of b6 you shouldn t have to worry about kidney stones at all the rda for b6 is 2mg per day for males and 1 6mg per day for females directly related to protein intake b6 can be toxic nerve damage if it is consumed in doses of 500mg or more per day for an extended peroid weeks to months the usda food survey done in 1986 had an average intake of 1 87 mg per day for males and 1 16mg per day for females living in the u s coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet which greatly increases the b6 requirement as well as the presence of some of the 40 different drugs that either block b6 absorption are metabolic antagonists of b6 or promote b6 excretion in the urine common ones are birth control pills alcohol isoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroids i tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the b6 requirement the dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is 10 15mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the b6 requirement this would be on top of your dietary intake of b6 any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given b6 supplements one other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your ca mg dietary ratio is 2 1 magnesium oxalate is much more soluble than is calcium oxalate 4 the magnesium calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate calculi invest urol 10 147 1972 5 effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine changes producted by food magnesium interaction j urol 143 2 248 51 1990 6 review article magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment of renal calcium stones j presse med 161 1 25 27 1987 there are actually about three times as many articles published in the medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation than there are for b6 i thought that i was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in this news group but good old john a in mass jumped all over me i guess that he doesn t read the medical literature oh well since kidney stones can be a real pain and a lot of people suffer from them i thought i d

3 | ah there s the rub and a catch 22 to boot for the purposes of a contest you ll probably not compete if n you can t afford the ride to get there and although lower priced delivery systems might be doable without demand its doubtful that anyone will develop a new system course if a low priced system existed there might be demand i wonder if there might be some way of structuring a contest to encourage low cost payload delivery systems the accounting methods would probably be the hardest to work out for example would you allow rockwell to loan you the engines and so forth this depends on the how soon the new launch system comes on line in other words perhaps a great deal of worthwhile technology life support navigation etc could be developed prior to a low cost launch system you wouldn t want to use the expensive stuff forever but i d hate to see folks waiting to do anything until a low cost mac oops i mean launch system comes on line i guess i d simplify this to say that waste is a slippery concept if your goal is manned lunar exploration in the next 5 years then perhaps its not wasted money if your goal is to explore the moon for under 500 million then you should put of this exploration for a decade or so craig
1 | yes i know it sounds crazy call it an urge call it what you want just don t ask why anyway i d like to build a uv flashlight cheaply flashlight means it should be reasonably portable but could have a power pack if necessary my main question is the bulb where can i get uv bulbs do they need a lot of power etc etc i m not too concerned with whether it s long wave or short wave but hey if anyone has a cheap source of bulbs i ll take both check out a medical supply catalog the thing you are looking for is called a woods lamp so you can check for woods sign certain skin conditions flourecse sp under uv light they come in disposable penlight like types and larger ac powered types it is also used in eye examinations a flourescent dye is introduced to the surface of the eye then uv is shined on it shows up scratches and abrasions very clearly that would otherwise be very difficult to detect for the completest the dye is called flouescien and in normal light appears orangish and leaves a mild burning sensation to the eye for 10 15 minutes until the tears flush it all out have fun
1 | i have a new scope and i thought i d save a few bucks by buying one with a function generator built in after having it awhile i noticed two things about the function generator for one there seems to be a bias even when the pull offset is pushed in that is i have to pull that know and adjust it to get a signal sans some random 50mv bias the other _really_ annoying thing is that the damn output won t go below about 1v p p i am a student you may have guessed from my previous posts and i often have to measure the input impedances of various circuits i build many of the circuits have maximum input signals of way less than 500mv amplitude and most have input impedances in the 10 s of kohm range the thing is in order to use my function generator i have to divide the voltage to some thing reasonable then of course to measurethe input impedance of my circuit i am going to have to throw in another resistor in series with the 50ohm output of the generator i could just ignore it but now with this little divider there i have to figure that in it s kind of a pain in the ass is there any way i could make myself a little box that could solve this little problem the box would tkae the function generator input lower the voltage and give an output impedance that is some low unchanging number i would want to lower the voltage by a factor of one hundred or so i could just build a little buffer amp but i d like to have this box not be active any quick ideas the scope s not broken for other reasons i had sent it to the shop to get repaired and they replaced it the function generator was the same way on that one too please help as i am feeling very stupid today

2 | this is the second post which seems to be blurring the distinction between real disease caused by candida albicans and the disease that was being asked about systemic yeast syndrome there is no question that candida albicans causes thrush it also seems to be the case that active yogurt cultures with acidophilous may reduce recurrences of thrush at least for vaginal thrush i ve never heard of anyone taking it for oral thrush before though presumably it would work by the same mechanism candida is clearly a common minor pathogen and a less common major pathogen that does not mean that there is evidence that it causes the systemic yeast syndrome
3 | well said okay del so michael was being unfair but you are being unfair back he is taking college courses now i presume he is studying hard and his postings reveal that he is somewhat hip to the technical issues of astronautics plus he is attentively following the erudite discourse of the big brains who post to sci space is it not inevitable that he will get a splendid technical education from reading the likes of you and me 1 like others involved in sci space mr adams shows symptoms of being a fledgling member of the technoculture and i think he s soaking it up fast i was a young guy with dreams once and they led me to get a technical education to follow them up too bad i wound up in an assembly line job stamping out identical neutrinos day after day 1 though rumors persist that del and i are both pseudonyms of fred mccall

the earth the floor is the simulated lunar surface a global call for contributions is hereby made for material for the lunar surface and for the design and creation of scale models of lunar colony elements scenery and machine lets the ltm1 initial design has 3 tele operated machinelets 1 an ssto scale model which will be able to lift off hover and land 2 a bulldozerlet which will be able to move about in a quarry area and 3 a moon train which will traverse most of the simulated lunar surface each machinelet has a small tv camera utilizing a ccd tv chip mounted on it a personal computer digitizes the image including reducing picture content and doing data compression to allow for minimal images to be sent to the operator for control purposes and also return control signals the first machinelet to be set up will be the moon train since model trains with tv cameras built in are almost off the shelf items and control electronics for starting and stopping a train are minimal the user will receive an image once every 1 to 4 seconds depending on the speed of their data link to ltm1 next an ssto scale model with a ccd tv chip will be suspended from a servo motor operated wire frame mounted on the ceiling allowing for the ssto to be controlled by the operator to take off hover over the entire lunar landscape and land finally some tank models will be modified to be ccd tv chip equipped bulldozerlets the entire initial ltm1 will allow remote operators worldwide to receive minimal images while actually operating models for landing and takeoff traveling and doing work the entire system is based on commercially available items and parts that can be easily obtained except for the interface electronics which is well within the capability of many advanced ham radio operator and computer hardware software developers by taking a graphically oriented communications program dmodem and adding a tele operations screen and controls the necessary user interface can be provided in under 80 man hours plan of action the diaspar virtual reality network has agreed to sponsor this project by providing a host computer network and internet access to that network diaspar is providing the 14 foot by 8 foot facility for actual construction of the lunar model diaspar has in stock the electronic tanks that can be modified and one ccd tv chip diaspar also agrees to provide rail stock for the lunar train model diaspar will make available the dmodem graphical communications package and modify it for control of the machines lets an initial ground breaking with miniature shovels will be performed for a live photo session and news conference on april 30 1993 the initial models will be put in place a time lapse record will be started for historical purposes it is not expected that this event will be completely serious or solemn the lunar colony will be declared open for additional building operations and experiments a photographer will be present and the photographs taken will be converted to gif images for distribution world wide to major online networks and bbs s a press release will be issued calling for contributions of ideas time talent materials and scale models for the simulated lunar colony a contest for new designs and techniques for working on the moon will then be announced universities will be invited to participate the goal being to find instructors who wish to have class participation in various aspects of the lunar colony model field trips to ltm1 can be arranged and at that time the results of the class work will be added to the model contributors will then be able to tele operate any contributed machine lets once they return to their campus a monthly ltm1 newsletter will be issued both electronically online and via conventional means to the media any major new tele operated equipment addition will be marked with an invitation to the television news media having a large real model space colony will be a very attractive photo opportunity for the television community especially since the action will be controlled by people all over the world science fiction writers will be invited to issue challenges to engineering and human factors students at universities to build and operate the tele operated equipment to perform lunar tasks using counter weight and pulley systems 1 6 gravity may be simulated to some extent to try various traction challenges the long term goal is creating world wide interest education experimentation and remote operation of a lunar colony ltm1 has the potential of being a long term global edutainment method for space activities and may be the generic example of how to teach and explore in many other subject areas not limited to space edutainment all of this facilitates the kind of spirit which can lead to a generation of people who are ready for the leap to the stars conclusion edutainment is the blending of education and entertainment anyone who has ever enjoyed seeing miniatures will probably see the potential impact of a globally available layout for recreation education and experimentation purposes by creating a tele operated model lunar colony we not only create world wide publicity but also a method of trying new ideas that require real not virtual skills and open a new method for putting people s minds in space moonlighters illuminating the path of knowledge about space and lunar development the following people are already engaged in various parts of this work david42 rob47 dash hyson jzer0 vril wyatt the dark one tiggertoo the mad hatter sir

1 | wow what a concept does anybody want to speculate on how this non connection would fit into the theft of cable services laws it seems to me that unless this case is specifically written into the legislation that the cable company would not have a leg to stand upon in court does anybody out there have any specific legal knowledge on this

3 | ethnocentric usian that i am i ve assumed that we and the xussr were the only countries with significant capabilities to track non cooperative objects in low earth orbit grazing in a couple of databases recently i found that japan has some optical capabilities along this line and also uses a radar designed for other purposes for orbital debris surveys it isn t clear whether the radar can determine orbital elements for the objects it detects abstracts of the articles are appended this leads to the more general question do yet other people than the us russia and japan do space surveillance and if so how and why allen thomson saic mclean va usa abstracts optical tracking of the experimental geodetic satellite egs takabe masao itabe toshikazu aruga tadashi radio research laboratory review issn 0033 801x vol 34 march 1988 p 23 34 in japanese with abstract in english this paper reports the optical tracking results of egs experimental geodetic satellite which was launched on august 13 1986 by nasda the egs optical tracking experiment process and an outline of the radio research laboratory rrl optical ground station are discussed a star tracking technique for optical equipment calibration and satellite tracking technique for orbit prediction improvement are also described the accuracy of egs tracking data obtained by rrl at the request of nasda is also discussed in addition it is briefly demonstrated that the position of the japanese amateur satellite jas 1 which was launched with the egs was accurately determined by means of a satellite tracking video it is clear from this experiment that optical observation data i e satellite direction data are very useful for satellite orbit determination during initial launch stages furthermore the results confirm the effectivenes of these two satellite optical tracking techniques mu radar measurements of orbital debris sato toru kayama hidetoshi furusawa akira kimura iwane kyoto university japan aiaa nasa and dod orbital debris conference technical issues and future directions baltimore md apr 16 19 1990 10 p rpn aiaa paper 90 1343 distributions of orbital debris versus height and scattering cross section are determined from a series of observations made with a high power vhf doppler radar mu radar of japan an automated data processing algorithm has been developed to discriminate echoes of orbiting objects from those of undesired signals such as meteor trail echoes or lightning atmospherics although the results are preliminary they showed good agreement with those from norad tracking radar observations using a much higher frequency it is found that the collision frequency of a space station of 1 km x 1 km size at an altitude of 500 km with orbiting debris is expected to be as high as once per two years monitoring of the mu radar antenna pattern by satellite ohzora exos c sato t inooka y fukao s kyoto univ japan kato s kyoto univ uji japan radio atmospheric science center in international council of scientific unions middle atmosphere program handbook for map vol 20 5 p publication date jun 1986 as the first attempt among mst mesosphere stratosphere troposphere type radars the mu middle and upper atmosphere radar features an active phased array system unlike the conventional large vhf radars in which output power of a large vacuum tube is distributed to individual antenna elements each of 475 solid state power amplifier feeds each antenna element this system configuration enables very fast beam steering as well as various flexible operations by dividing the antenna into independent subarrays because phase shift and signal division combination are performed at a low signal level using electronic devices under control of a computer network the antenna beam can be switched within 10 microsec to any direction within the zenith angle of 30 deg since a precise phase alignment of each element is crucial to realize the excellent performance of this system careful calibration of the output phase of each power amplifier and antenna element was carried out among various aircraft which may be used for this purpose artificial satellites have an advantage of being able to make a long term monitoring with the same system an antenna pattern monitoring system for the mu radar was developed using the scientific satellite ohzora exos c a receiver named mum mu radar antenna monitor on board the satellite measures a cw signal of 100 to 400 watts transmitted from the mu radar the principle of the measurement and results are discussed
2 | there has been no hard info provided about msg making people ill that s the point after all that s because these peer reviewed studies are not addressing the effects of msg in people they re looking at animal models you can t walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans note that i wouldn t have any argument with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its use in humans this is precisely not what you said it most certainly is for neurotoxicology you know studies of glutamate involve more than food science so point us to the studies in humans please i m familiar with the literature and i ve never seen any which relate at all to olney s work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons well actually they have to tolerate some phenylalanine it s a essential amino acid they just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood goodness i m not saying that it s good to feed infants a lot of glutamate supplemented foods it s just that this projected safety margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that you can prove anything you like we re talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here yet you re misrepresenting it as received wisdom you mean asserting you re being intellectually dishonest or just plain confused because you re conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other olney s reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants but that s not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of msg in most foods nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious reasons it says nothing about msg s contribtion to the phenomenon of the chinese restaurant syndrome it says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of msg sensitivity in the lab probably one of the dumber remarks you ve made
2 | i agree with everything that lee lady wrote in her previous post in this thread in case this puzzles people i would like to expand on two of her comments one of the most important and difficult aspects of reasoning about empirical investigation lies in understanding the context scope and importance of the various arguments and pieces of evidence that are marshalled for a claim some errors break the back of a piece of research some leave a hole that needs to be filled in and some are trivial in their importance it is a grave mistake to confuse these past snippets from this thread back to lee lady these posters are making the mistake that i have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe a carefully designed and controlled study is neither always possible nor always important on the other hand if someone is proposing a remedy that supposedly alleviates a chronic medical problem we have enough knowledge of the errors that have plagued this kind of claim to ask for a carefully designed and controlled study to alleviate our skepticism rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study are too narrow to apply to all investigation i think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things to reuse the previous example we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic
2 | following a series of miscarriages my wife was given a transfusion of my white cells the theory as i understand it is that there is some kind of immune blocking that prevents the body from attacking the pregnancy as it normally would a foreign body where this blocking is deficient the body evicts the intruder resulting in a miscarriage the white cells apparently enhance the blocking capability following the transfusion she successfully carried the next pregnancy to term and jake is now an active 9 month old who cannot wait to walk we re now thinking about having another child but no one including the obgyn who supervised the first transfusion really seems to know whether or not the transfusion process needs to be repeated for successive pregnancies is there anyone in net land who has experience with this thanks gene and jane and jake
1 | i had the good luck to obtain an eico dynamic conductance tube tester for a song unfortunately i was a little out of key the only thing wrong with it was an open meter movement does anyone know where i can find either another meter movement like it a dead but not the meter dead unit or schematics to specify the current scale of the meter movement i can cut and paste a more sensitive movement in if i can find what the full scale current was or is eico still contactable the thing is a model 666 nope not a joke or any sort of snide reference
3 | every aircraft has flight constraints for speed aoa power when graphed these define the flight envelope of that aircraft presumably so named because the graphed line encloses envelopes the area on the graph that represents conditions where the aircraft doesn t fall out of the sky hence pushing the envelope becomes operating at or beyond the edge of the flight or operational envelope note that the envelope isn t precisely known until someone actually flies the airplane in those regions up to that point all there are are the theoretical predictions hence one of the things test pilots do for a living is push the envelope to find out how close the correspondence between the paper airplane and the metal one is in essence pushing back the edges of the theoretical envelope to where the airplane actually starts to fail to fly note too that this is done is a quite calculated and careful way flight tests are generally carefully coreographed and just what is going to be pushed and how far is precisely planned despite occasional deviations from plans such as the early first flight of the f 16 during its high speed taxi tests i m sure mary can tell you everything you ever wanted to know about this process and then some insisting on perfect safety is for people who don t have the balls to live in the real world mary shafer nasa ames dryden

keyboard over the serial port if you ve got a proprietary computer which uses its own keyboard sun hp dec etc then you re going to have a hard time finding a vendor to sell you a compatible keyboard if your workstation runs the x window system you re in luck you can buy a cheap used pc hook your expensive keyboard up to it and run a serial cable to your workstation then run a program on the workstation to read the serial port and generate fake x keyboard events the two main programs i ve found to do this are kt and a2x a2x is a sophisticated program capable of controlling the mouse and even moving among widgets on the screen it requires a server extension xtest dec xtrap or xtestextension1 to find out if your server can do this run xdpyinfo and see if any of these strings appear in the extensions list if your server doesn t have this you may want to investigate compiling x11r5 patchlevel 18 or later or bugging your vendor kt is a simpler program which should work with unextended x servers another program called xsendevent also exists but i haven t seen it both a2x and kt are available via anonymous ftp from soda berkeley edu 2 x terminals also a number of x terminals ncd tektronics to name a few use pc compatible keyboards if you have an x terminal you may be all set try it out with a normal pc keyboard before you go through the trouble of buying an alternative keyboard also some x terminals add extra buttons you may need to keep your original keyboard around for the once in a blue moon that you have to hit the setup key 3 next next had announced that new next machines will use the apple desktop bus meaning any mac keyboard will work then they announced they were cancelling their hardware production if you want any kind of upgrade for an older next do it now 4 silicon graphics silicon graphics has announced that their newer machines indigo 2 and beyond will use standard pc compatible keyboards and mice i don t believe this also applies to the power

1 | my next project is to come up with an if detector module for fast 112 to 250 kb sec packet radio use no fancy modulation scheme just wide fsk for use at 902 or 1296 mhz i m a bit familiar with the motorola 3362 chip but i wonder if there are newer designs that might work at higher input frequencies my goal is to come up with an inexpensive design for a receiver back end with if input on one end and an fsk demondulator on the other i m particularly interested in ways to use a higher if than 10 7 do any current chips work up to say 150mhz with internal downconversion so a normal if filter can be used any suggestions john

arrange 3 general info on injuries first and foremost of importance if you experience pain at all then you absolutely need to go see a doctor as soon as you possibly can the difference of a day or two can mean the difference between a short recovery and a long drawn out ordeal go see a doctor now your garden variety doctor may not necessarily be familiar with this sort of injury generally any hospital with an occupational therapy clinic will offer specialists in these kinds of problems don t wait though go see a doctor the remainder of this information is paraphrased without permission from a wonderful report by new zealand s department of labour occupational safety and health service occupational overuse syndrome treatment and rehabilitation a practitioner s guide first a glossary or fancy names for how you shouldn t have your hands note you re likely to hear these terms from doctors and keyboard vendors rsi repetitive strain injury a general term for many kinds of injuries oos occupational overuse syndrome synonym for rsi ctd cumulative trauma disorder another synonym for rsi wruld work related upper limb disorders yet another synonym for rsi cts carpal tunnel syndrome see below hyperextension marked bending at a joint pronation turning the palm down wrist extension bending the wrist up supination turning the palm up wrist flexion bending the wrist down pinch grip the grip used for a pencil ulnar deviation bending the wrist towards the little finger power grip the grip used for a hammer radial deviation bending the wrist toward the thumb abduction moving away from the body overspanning opening the fingers out wide now then problems come in two main types local conditions and diffuse conditions local problems are what you d expect specific muscles tendons tendon sheaths nerves etc being inflamed or otherwise hurt diffuse conditions often mistaken for local problems can involve muscle discomfort pain burning and or tingling with identifiable areas of tenderness in muscles although they re not necessarily the problem why does occupational overuse syndrome occur here s the theory normally your muscles and tendons get blood through capillaries which pass among the muscle fibers when you tense a muscle you restrict the blood flow by the time you re exerting 50 of your full power you re completely restricting your blood flow without fresh blood your muscles use stored energy until they run out then they switch to anaerobic without oxygen metabolism which generates nasty by products like lactic acid which cause pain once one muscle hurts all its neighbors tense up perhaps to relieve the load this makes sense for your normal sort of injury but it only makes things worse with repetitive motion more tension means less blood flow and the cycle continues another by product of the lack of blood flow is tingling and numbness from your nerves they need blood too anyway when you re typing too much you re never really giving a change for the blood to get back where it belongs because your muscles never relax enough to let the blood through stress poor posture and poor ergonomics only make things worse specific injuries you may have heard of note most injuries come in two flavors acute and chronic acute injuries are severely painful and noticable chronic conditions have less pronounced symptoms but are every bit as real tenosynovitis an inflamation of the tendon sheath chronic tenosynovitis occurs when the repetitive activity is mild or intermittent not enough to cause acute inflamation but enough to exceed the tendon sheath s ability to lubricate the tendon as a result the tendon sheath thickens gets inflamed and you ve got your problem tendonitis an inflammation of a tendon repeated tensing of a tendon can cause inflamation eventually the fibers of the tendon start separating and can even break leaving behind debris which induces more friction more swelling and more pain sub acute tendonitis is more common which entails a dull ache over the wrist and forearm some tenderness and it gets worse with repetitive activity carpal tunnel syndrome the nerves that run through your wrist into your fingers get trapped by the inflamed muscles around them symptoms include feeling pins and needles tingling numbness and even loss of sensation cts is often confused for a diffuse condition adverse mechanical tension also known as neural tension this is where the nerves running down to your arm have become contracted and possibly compressed as a result of muscle spasms in the shoulders and elsewhere amt can often misdiagnosed as or associated with one of the other oos disorders it is largely reversible and can be treated with physiotherapy brachial plexus stretches and trigger point therapy others for just about every part of your body there s a fancy name for a way to injure it by now you should be getting an idea of how oos conditions occur and why just be careful many inexperienced doctors misdiagnose problems as carpal tunnel syndrome when in reality you may have a completely different problem always get a second opinion before somebody does something drastic to you like surgery 4 typing posture ergonomics prevention treatment the most important element of both prevention and recovery is to reduce tension in the muscles and tendons this requires learning how to relax if you re under a load of stress this is doubly important tune out the world and breath deep and regular relaxing should become a guiding principle in your work every three minutes take a three second break every three minutes take a three second break really do it every three minutes it s also helpful to work in comfortable surroundings calm down and relax if you can t sleep you really need to focus on this rest sleep and relaxation are really a big deal there are all kinds of other treatments of course drugs can reduce inflamation and pain custom molded splints can forcefully prevent bad posture surgery can fix some problems exercise can help strengthen your muscles regular stretching can help prevent injury good posture and a good ergonomic workspace promote reduced tension ice or hot cold contrast baths also reduce swelling only your doctor can say what s best for you posture here are some basic guidelines i so liked the way this was written in the new zealand book that i m lifting it almost verbatim from appendix 10 dwallach let your shoulders relax let your elbows swing free keep your wrists straight pull your chin in to look down don t flop your head forward keep the hollow in the base of your spine try leaning back in the chair don t slouch or slump forward alter your posture from time to time every 20 minutes get up and bend your spine backward set the seat height first your feet should be flat on the floor there should be no undue pressure on the underside of your thighs near the knees and your thighs should not slope too much now draw yourself up to your desk and see that its height is comfortable to work at if you are short this may be impossible the beest remedy is to raise the seat height and prevent your legs from dangling by using a footrest now adjust the backrest height so that your buttocks fit into the space between the backrest and the seat pan the backrest should support you in the hollow of your back so adjust its tilt to give firm support in this area if you operate a keyboard you will be able to spend more time leaning back so experiment with a chair with a taller backrest if available now i diverge a little from the text a good chair makes a big difference if you don t like your chair go find a better one you really want adjustments for height back angle back height and maybe even seat tilt most arm rests seem to get in the way although some more expensive chairs have height adjustable arm rests which you can also rotate out of the way you should find a good store and play with all these chairs pick one that s right for you in the san francisco bay area i highly recommend just chairs the name says it all keyboard drawers wrist pads and keyboard replacements there is a fair amount of controvery on how to get this right for some people wrist pads seem to work wonders however with good posture you shouldn t be resting your wrists on anything you would prefer your keyboard to be right there if you drop your arms at your side and then lift your hands up at the elbow you want your keyboard under your hands when your elbows are at about 90 degrees of course you want to avoid pronation wrist extension and ulnar deviation at all costs wrist pads may or may not help at this you should get somebody else to come and look at how you work how you sit how you type and how you relax it s often easier for somebody else to notice your hunched shoulders or deviated hands some argue that the normal flat keyboard is antiquated and poorly designed a number of replacements are available on the market today check out the accompanying typing injury faq keyboards for much detail 5 requests for more info clearly the above information is incomplete the typing injury archive is incomplete there s always more information out there if you d like to submit something please send me mail and i ll gladly throw it in if you d like to maintain a list of products or vendors that would be wonderful i d love

2 | maybe maybe not a new graduate would obviously be well trained but perhaps without sufficient experience a radiologist trained 10 or 15 years ago who has not kept his continuing education current is a whole nuther matter a ob who has trained in modern radiology technology is certainly more qualified than the latter and at least equal to the former if the radiologist is also trained in ob gyn why not john
1 | we ll let you live but just this once there s more to a real storage scope than just a long persistence phosphor actually the phosphor isn t usually anything special at all what makes a storage tube work is a screen placed just behind the phosphor which becomes charged as the electron beam intially writes the trace with the trace now written to the screen a separate low level flood electron gun keeps the image lit by exciting those areas of phosphor which are next to the written areas on the storage screen there are some problems with this the resolution is limited compared to a non storage tube and the stored trace tends to bloom with time of course this is pretty much obsolete technology done in by the current digital scopes which use raster scan displays and keep everything in a frame buffer memory anyways ah yes from the same people who brought you that amazing new reading program that s sweeping eastern europe hooked on consonants

3 | let s see these aren t in a strict sense amateur rockets that term denotes rockets the engines of which are constructed by the user the rockets you describe are called hpr or high power rockets to distinguish them from smaller model rockets they use factory made ammonium perchlorate composite propellants in phenolic plastic engines with graphite nozzles the engines are classified by impulse a d engine for example can have no more than 20 newton seconds of impulse an f engine can have no more than 40 ns each letter corresponds to a doubling of the maximum impulse so far engines up to size o are available pretty much off the shelf engines of size h and above are shipped as class b explosives and as such are controlled engines of size f and below are shipped as class c explosives and are not as controlled class f engines btw are not hpr engines but model rocket engines class g engines go in and out of legal limbo there is an hpr society the tripoli rocket society i believe which holds events at various sites throughout the year with all legalities faa waiver included taken care of the national association of rocketry is more concerned with engines below h though it is involved in hpr as well these societies certify users of hpr rockets and companies will not sell to uncertified individuals bottom line it s legit i suggest you send for a catalog but forget the dynamite will ya

2 | hi i ve just returned from a visit with my ob gyn and i have a few concerns that maybe y all can help me with i ve been seeing her every 4 weeks for the past few months i m at week 28 and during the last 2 visits i ve gained 9 to 9 1 2 pounds every 4 weeks she said this was unacceptable over any 4 week period as it stands i ve thus far gained 26 pounds also she says that though i m at 28 weeks the baby s size is 27 weeks i think she mentioned 27 inches for the top of the fundus when i was 13 weeks the baby s size was 14 weeks i must also add that i had an operation a few years ago for endometriosis and i ve had no problems with endometriosis but apparently it is causing me pain in my pelvic region during the pregnancy and i have a very difficult time moving and the doc has recommended i not walk or move unless i have to i have a little handicapped sticker for when i do need to go out anyway that s 1 2 of the situation the other is that almost from the beginning of pregnancy i was getting sick throwing up about 2 3 times a day and mostly it was bile that was being eliminated i told her about this i know this because i wasn t eating very much due to the nausea and could see the results well now i only get sick about once every 1 2 weeks and it is still bile related but in addition i had begun to feel movement near my upper right abdomen just below the right breast usually when i was lying on my right side it began to get worse though because it started to hurt when i lay on my right side and then it hurt no matter what position i was in next i noticed that when i ate greasy or fatty foods i felt like my entire abdomen had turned to stone and the pain in the area got worse however if i ate sauerkraut or vinegar or something to cut the fat it wasn t as much of a problem so the doctor says i have cholistatis and that i should avoid fatty foods this makes sense and because i was already aware of what seemed to me this cause and effect relationship i have been avoiding these foods on my own but i m still able to eat foods with ricotta cheese for instance and other low fat foods but doc wants me to be on a non fat diet this means no meat except fish and chicken w o skin i do this anyway no nuts fried food cheese etc i am allowed skim milk she said i should avoid anything sweet e g bananas also i must only have one serving of something high in carbohydrates a day potatoes pasta rice she said i can t even cook vegetables in a little bit of oil and that i should eat vegetables raw or steamed i m concerned because i understand you need to have some fat in your diet to help in the digestive process and if i m not taking in fat is she expecting the baby will take it from my stores and why this restriction on carbohydrates if she s concerned about fat i m not clear how much of her recommendation is based on my weight gain and how much on cholistatis which i can t seem to find any information on she originally said that i should only gain 20 pounds during the entire pregnancy since i was about 20 lbs overweight when i started but my sister gained 60 lbs during her pregnancy and she s taken it all off and hasn t had any problems she also asked if any members of my family were obese which none of them are anyway i think she is overly concerned about weight gain and feel like i m being punished by a severe diet she did want to see me again in one week so i think she the diet may be temporary for that one week what i want to know is how reasonable is this non fat diet i would understand if she had said low fat diet since i m trying that anyway even if she said really low fat diet i think she assumes i must be eating a high fat diet but really it is that because of the endometriosis and the operation i m not able to use the energy from the food i do eat any opinions info and experiences will be appreciated i m truly going stark raving mad trying to meet this new strict diet because fruits and vegetables go through my system in a few minutes and i ll end up having to eat constantly thus far i don t find any foods satisfying thanks
2 | hismanal astemizole is most definitely linked to weight gain it really is peculiar that some antihistamines have this effect and even more so an antihistamine like astemizole which purportedly doesn t cross the blood brain barrier and so tends not to cause drowsiness
3 | this isn t inherently bad this isn t really light pollution since it will only be visible shortly before or after dusk or during the day of course if night only lasts 2 hours for you you re probably going to be inconvienenced but you re inconvienenced anyway in that case finally this isn t the bronze age and most of us aren t indo european those people speaking indo eurpoean languages often have much non indo european ancestry and cultural background so please try to remember that there are more human activities than those practiced by the warrior caste the farming caste and the priesthood and why act distressed that someone s found a way to do research that doesn t involve socialism it certianly doesn t mean we deserve to die

2 | snort ah there go my sinuses again oh wow a classic textbook hey they laughed at einstein too yeah i ll bet tomorrow the world listen uncontrolled studies like this are worthless i m sure you are you sound like the typical hysteric hypochondriac who responds to miracle cures yeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriously snort yeah it sounds reasonable to me oh really _what_ tests immune compromised my ass more like credulous malingerer this is a psychiatric syndrome you know it s a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused in this way it s ridiculously expensive and potentially toxic the trouble is that it isn t toxic enough so it gets abused by quacks the only good thing about nystatin is that it s relatively cheap and when taken orally non toxic but oral nystatin is without any systemic effect so unless it were given iv it would be without any effect on your sinuses i wish these quacks would first use iv nystatin or amphotericin b on people like you that would solve the yeast problem once and for all perhaps a little haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating your symptoms are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket i d hate to think my insurance premiums are going towards this
3 | thanks ron and peter for some very nice maps i have an advice though you wrote that the maps were reduced to 256 colors as far ad i understand jpeg pictures gets much better and the compressed files smaller if you use the original 3 color 24 bit data when converting to jpeg thanks again
1 | i really don t know where to post this question so i figured that this board would be most appropriate i was wondering about those massive concrete cylinders that are ever present at nuclear poer sites they look like cylinders that have been pinched in the middle does anybody know what the actual purpose of those things are i hear that they re called cooling towers but what the heck do they cool i hope someone can help during the nuclear fission reaction the uranium fuel can get hot enough to melt when this happens the liquid uranium is pumped to the cooling tower where it is sprayed into the air contact with the cool outside air will condense the mist and it will fall back to the cooling tower floor there it is collected by a cleaning crew using shop vacs and is then reformed into pellets for reactor use the next day cooling towers are a lot taller than they really need to be power companies are forced to make them that tall by some enviromental law that requires the raw uranium emisions to be held to under 1 this law is now under attack by lawyers arguing that the 1 should be measured at the edge of the property rather than the edge of the cooling tower eliminating this law will save power companies thousands of dollars in concrete costs for new nukes
1 | there was a news article a little while ago reporting a type of car was it a volvo was found to stall if you used a certain brand model of cellular phone in it i seem to remember the car was recalled to fix the problem
3 | the centaur that is being built for t4 would be a better bet to integrate onto the proton as the t4 centaur is designed for the extremely harsh envorinment of the t4 launch it is also closer to 4 m in diameter you ve hit on the real kicker however the centaur is pressure stabilized it cannot hold up its own weight without pressure in the tanks additionally the pressure difference between the two tanks must be maintained to 5 psi that is rather tight to be rocking and rolling on the train the pressure stabilization is how centaur achieves the performance on numerous occasions when i was there 88 91 the af wanted to see what it would take to make a non pressure stabilized centaur the answer a centaur not worth launching the atlas centaur does not require on pad integration however the t4 centaur does i believe the on pad integration is to a great extent due to the cleanliness requirements and pfl configuration so maybe something can be done there the addition of lox lh facilities is critical as the centaur tops off as it lifts off a lhe facility is also needed i don t know what the proton uses for fuel but since they are derived from icbm s i would suspect that they use storable propellants which don t have the ullage problem that cryo s do if there is no cryo at the sight at all the addition of these systems could be big not to mention the real tech transfer issues involved with providing centaur gse to russia that issue alone might be enough to kill this idea
1 | it s made by rohm as is all baxxx parts call 714 855 2131 and ask if you can get a sample it s only like a 2 part

3 | hmm 1 billion lesse i can probably launch 100 tons to leo at 200 million in five years which gives about 20 tons to the lunar surface one way say five tons of that is a return vehicle and its fuel a bigger mercury or something might get that as low as two tons leaving fifteen tons for a one man habitat and a year s supplies gee with that sort of mass margins i can build the systems off the shelf for about another hundred million tops that leaves about 700 million profit i like this idea 8 let s see if you guys can push someone to make it happen 8 8 slightly seriously

3 | piper lived in my town williamsport pa when he killed himself it was in the early 60 s he had had more than a few books published by that time but he was down on his luck financially rumor was that he was hunting urban pigeons with birdshot for food he viewed himself as a resourceful man and imo decided to check out gracefully if he couldn t support himself the worst part is that john campbell the long time editor of astounding analog sf magazine had cut a check for piper s most recent story and said check was in the mail if campbell had known piper s straits i m sure he would have phoned to say hang on campbell was like that i wish it had happened differently i always enjoyed piper s stuff
1 | may i respectfully suggest you not do this the ground is supposed to be a protective ground and though what you suggest looks good on paper it s dangerous to rely on the same wire for power and protection it d never meet code and if you now own the property and later sell it you may end up with liabilities you don t want and if you _don t_ now own it well
1 | ok here could be the first question or answer or something q i want to copyprotect a program i wrote how should i do it a you would be wise not to copyprotect that program you see those people that wants to get a cracked copy of your program will go to various length to crack your program and some of those crackers are good and know the common tricks so the copy protection wouldn t stop those ok then what about legitimate users copy protection can be a hassle for legitimate users and can hinder them in their work expecially if there is some key item that can get lost so the copy protection wouldn t help much of the legitimate users but would make life somewhat of a misery for them this is my opinion and i speak as a legitimate user you are of course free to have your opinion about this subject
1 | what you have is one of the ld players from a video game dragon s lair space ace etc call pioneer technicial support 213 498 0300 at least that s the number i called them at and ask for the ld v1000 interface guide it shows how the parallel interface should be wired and the codes for the commands play pause reject etc the guide is mainly for hooking the player to a computer but with a little work you could build a wired controller
1 | are you sure that he needs a two way converter if he wants only rs232 ttl i would suggest the mc1489 its very cheap 0 80 dm in germany this chip needs only 5v the mc1488 ttl rs232 converter uses 12v and 12v btw the max232 and compatibles seem to be expensive in the usa i paid 2 95 dm for a its80272 made by harris its absolutely compatible with the max232 or the icl232 gerrit
1 | the point is that the original poster was talking about connecting ground and neutral in the outlet box big no no and you are talking about them being connected in the breaker box as things should be if this is not obvious the point is that there should be current flow in the white i e neutral return wires when things in the house are operating there should not be any flow in the ground wires unless there is a fault condition notice also that in the breaker box there is a wire leading from the above mentioned junction to earth ground usually a pipe or spike driven into the ground
3 | i hold that space cannot be curved for the simple reason that it can have no properties of properties we can only speak when dealing with matter filling the space to say that in the presence of large bodies space becomes curved is equivalent to stating that something can act upon nothing i for one refuse to subscribe to such a view nikola tesla et tesla was 100 years ahead of his time perhaps now his time comes
3 | i was assuming that there won t be a moon base unless it makes a profit actually if it does well that gives a larger gnp which leads to being able to spend more money on your military including gosh wow space stuff assuming it s profitable rather than paying for itself you might be able to _run_ one for that put it there hardly why do you think at least a couple centuries before there will be significant commerical activity on the moon
3 | i just got out of the army go signal corps or intelligence photointelligence interpretation if you go ada you might get to play with rockets but space will look pretty far away dug in the mud next to a grunt protecting the foward troops from low flying objects good luck
3 | for an essay i am writing about the space shuttle and a need for a better propulsion system through research i have found that it is rather clumsy i e all the checks tests before launch the safety hazards sitting on a hydrogen bomb etc if you have any beefs about the current space shuttle program re propulsion please send me your ideas thanks a lot
3 | i would just like to point out that it is much easier to place an object at orbital altitude than it is to place it with orbital velocity for a target 300 km above the surface of earth you need a delta v of 2 5 km s assuming that rockets with specific impulses of 300 seconds are easy to produce a rocket with a dry weight of 50 kg would require only about 65 kg of fuel oxidizer a small dispersal charge embedded in about 20 kg of sand or birdshot depending on the nature of the structure would be the payload i am sure the whole project is well within the capability of the amateur rocketry community it sounds like a good science fair project reduction of light pollution through applied ballistics or it could be part of the challenge prize being discussed here 1 billion for the first person to spend 1 year on the moon 1 million for the first erradication of an orbital eyesore ccd burner i wouldpledge 1000 for the first person to bring it down and i am sure there are at least 999 other astronomers nature lovers or just plain people of good taste who would do likewise of course a gerald bull solution might be simpler either the solution gerald bull would apply the use of a large caliber gun or the solution which was applied to gerald bull the use of a small caliber gun
1 | i want to upgrade my system and was thinking of buying adcom seperates i have heard from alot of people though that adcom sounds great but that the components are made cheaply and therefore won t last very long the time estimates i ve heard are like only 3 or 4 years is this true i own the adcom 60w power amp as far as i m concerned there s no amp which can touch it at the price range the build quality is very impressive and is far superior to other amps in the price range the whole amplifier is extremely solid with massive heat sinks and very solid casing if you open the amp up there are only very good quality components in and the amp seems to be designed extremely well perfect symmetry for both channels and two transformers one for each channel the binding posts on the back of the amplifier are virtually the same as those on the classe model 70 ie very good i was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far east or where ever but if you look in the amp and see what components they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the amplifiers sound so brilliant i cannot see why people say the amplifier won t last not with those quality components inside sure the amp runs very fairly hot but that s how you get an amp to sound incredibly good my last point i recently auditioned the adcom preamp something like the 545 or something it was two years old and it still sounded like new if you build an amplifier decently like the adcom s they will sound brilliant and last a long time period just my thoughts but then i do own one of adcom s amps
2 | if it were my wife i would insist that a radiologist be involved in the process radiologist are intensively trained in the process of interpreting diagnostic imaging data and are aware of many things that other physicians aren t aware of would you want a radiologist to deliver your baby if you wouldn t then why would you want a ob gyn to read your ultrasound study in my opinion the process should involve a ob gyn and a radiologist
1 | my 9 yr old son has signed up to do a science report on batteries i was wondering if anyone could provide me with some information as to how to construct a home built battery in my grade school days i remember seeing the ice cube tray version but i don t remember what to use as a good electrolyte or what the easily obtainable metals were thank you in advance i remember watching a whole mr wizzard program on this subject when i was a kid the battery constructed on the program which made the biggest impression on me and generated the most power was made using a galvanized bucket for the zinc and a copper toilet tank float the electrolyte was sauerkraut

3 | mcdonnell douglas rolls out dc x huntington beach calif on a picture perfect southern california day mcdonnell douglas rolled out its dc x rocket ship last saturday the company hopes this single stage rocket technology demonstrator will be the first step towards a single stage to orbit ssto rocket ship the white conical vehicle was scheduled to go to the white sands missile range in new mexico this week flight tests will start in mid june although there wasn t a cloud in the noonday sky the forecast for ssto research remains cloudy the sdi organization which paid 60 million for the dc x can t itself afford to fund full development of a follow on vehicle to get the necessary hundreds of millions required for a sub orbital dc xa sdio is passing a tin cup among its sister government agencies sdio originally funded ssto research as a way to cut the costs for orbital deployments of space based sensors and weapns however recent changes in sdi s political marching orders and budget cuts have made ssto less of a priority today the agency is more interested in using dc x as a step towards a low cost reusable sounding rocket sdio has already done 50 briefings to other government agencies said col simon pete worden sdio s deputy for technology but worden declined to say how much the agencies would have to pony up for the program i didn t make colonel by telling my contractors how much money i have available to spend he quipped at a press conference at mcdonnell douglas astronautics headquarters while sdio has lowered its sights on the program s orbital objective agency officials hail the dc x as an example of the better faster cheaper approach to hardware development the agency believes this philosophy can produce breakthroughs that leapfrog ahead of evolutionary technology developments worden said the dc x illustrates how a build a little test a little approach can produce results on time and within budget he said the program which went from concept to hardware in around 18 months showed how today s engineers could move beyond the miracles of our parents time the key is management worden said sdio had a very light hand on this project we had only one overworked major jess sponable although the next phase may involve more agencies worden said lean management and a sense of government industry partnership will be crucial it s essential we do not end up with a large management structure where the price goes up exponentially sdio s approach also won praise from two california members of the house science space and technology committee this is the direction we re going to have to go said rep george brown the committee s democratic chairman programs that stretch aout 10 to 15 years aren t sustainable nasa hasn t learned it yet sdio has rep dana rohrbacher brown s republican colleague went further joking that a shrimp is a fish designed by a nasa design team rohrbacher doubted that the program ever would have been completed if it were left to the civil space agency rohrbacher whose orange county district includes mcdonnell douglas also criticized nasa air force work on conventional multi staged rockets as placing new casings around old missile technology let s not build fancy ammunition with capsules on top let s build a spaceship although rohrbacher praised sdio s sponsorship he said the private sector needs to take the lead in developing ssto technology mcdonnell douglas which faces very uncertain prospects with its c 17 transport and space station freedom programs were more cautious about a large private secotro commitment on very large ventures companies put in seed money said charles ordahl mcdonnell douglas senior vice president for space systems you need strong government investments while the government and industry continue to differ on funding for the dc xa they agree on continuing an incremental approach to development citing corporate history they liken the process to douglas aircraft s dc aircraft just as two earlier aircraft paved the way for the dc 3 transport a gradual evolution in single stage rocketry could eventually lead to an orbital delta clipper dc 1 flight tests this summer at white sands will expand the envelope of performance with successive tests increasing speed and altitude the first tests will reach 600 feet and demonstrate hovering verticle take off and landing the second series will send the unmanned dc x up to 5 000 feet the third and final series will take the craft up to 20 000 feet maneuvers will become more complex on third phase the final tests will include a pitch over manever that rotates the vehicle back into a bottom down configuration for a soft four legged landing the flight test series will be supervised by charles pete conrad who performed similar maneuvers on the apollo 12 moon landing now a mcdonnell douglas vice president conrad paised the vehicles aircraft like approach to operations features include automated check out and access panels for easy maintainance if the program moves to the next stage engine technology will become a key consideration this engine would have more thrust than the pratt whitney rl10a 5 engines used on the dc x each motor uses liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants to generate up to 14 760 pounds of thrust based on the engine used in centaur upper stages the a 5 model has a thrust champer designed for sea level operation and three to on throttling capability it also is designed for repeat firings and rapid turnaround worden said future single stage rockets could employ tri propellant engine technology developed in the former soviet union the resulting engines could burn a dense hydrocarbon fuel at takeoff and then switch to liquid hydrogen at higher altitudes
1 | just a shot here but ya never know i once bought a real cheap equalizer power amp for my car tape player at one of those motel room truckload sales and it sounded great for a while that is then one channel quit entirely i opened it up and the amplifier chip for the bad channel had simply melted some of its solder joints attaching it to the pcb i soldered them back and it worked fine i just had to keep the volume a bit lower than i did before probably lousy heat sinking you said a nice alpine which i m sure is a few orders of mag higher in quality than the p o s i had but the point is look inside before you scrap it since you occasionally find something you can repair maybe even the same thing i found

2 | for a brief but pretty detailed account try hempel s _philosophy of natural science_ this smacks a bit of ideology the supposition being that toricelli s subsequent descriptions of his reasoning are not veridical it gets dangerously close to an unfalsifiable view of the history and methodology of science if we deny that no subsequent reports of experimenters are reliable descriptions of their real reasons but my point is that this type of case is not a rarity in fact i was going to point to pasteur as yet another rather common example particularly the studies on spontaneous generation and fermentation i will readily concede that ridiculous reasons can play an important role in how scientists spend their time but one should not confuse motivation with methodology nor suppose that ridiculous reasons provide the impetus in the majority of cases based on relatively infrequent anecdotal evidence
2 | your doctor is right it is best to do nothing besides taking some pain medication initially some patients don t like this and expect or demand to have something done in these cases some physicians will tape the patient put a lot of heavy adhesive tape around the chest or prescribe an elastic binder all this does is make it harder to breath but the patient doesn t feel cheated because soemthing is being done about the problem either way the end results are the same
1 | i was wondering if anyone can shed any light on just how it is that these electronic odometers remember the total elapsed mileage what kind of memory is stable reliable enough non volatile enough and independent enough of outside battery power to last say 10 years or more in the life of a vehicle i m amazed that anything like this could be expected to work for this length of time especially in light of all the gizmos i work with that are doing good to work for 2 months without breaking down somehow side question how about the legal ramifications of selling a used car with a replaced odometer that starts over at 0 miles after say 100 200 300k actual miles looks like fraud would be fairly easy for the price of a new odometer you can say it has however many miles you want to tell the buyer it has thanks for any insight

1 | well they claim they are the only radio broadcaster with this information but the city s cable channel 35 in cablevision areas shows this information map during travel times 6 9am and 4 7pm i believe most of the major la freeways are covered the computer generated map shows green yellow red or flashing red respectively 40mph 25 40mph 25mph and incident i might be off a little on the speeds since this is from memory i often look at this display in the morning to see if i really want to fight the traffic on the sepulveda pass or work from home for a little while to wait for it to clear another poster explained the origin of the information sensors embedded wire loops in the pavement near ramps and every half mile or so caltrans has had a big board driven from this data in their traffic control center for some time i don t know if they are selling the data or if anyone with the equipment necessary for its transmission and display can have it

1 | not hard you can do the refreshing and access cycles by software but this hogs most of the available cpu cycles on a low end controller i ve seen some application note from philips that used one of their 8051 derivatives as a printer buffer with up to 1mb of dynamic ram that was accessed and refreshed with software bit banging another alternative would be to use one of those nice dram controller chips that create static ram appearance and all that but they may be too expensive to make it worthwhile

2 | not that new 20 years ago we had drug addicts harboring active tb that was resistant to everything in chicago the difference now is that such strains have become virulent in the old days such tb was weak it didn t spread to other people very easily and just infected the one person in whom it developed because of non compliance with medications non compliance and development of resistant strains has been a problem for a very long time that is why we have like 9 drugs against tb there is always a need to develop new ones due to such strains now however with a virulent resistant strain we are in more trouble and measures to assure compliance may be necessary even if they entail force gordon banks n3jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb cadre dsl pitt edu it is shameful to surrender it too soon

3 | mcdonnell douglas rolls out dc x ssto research remains cloudy the sdi organization which paid 60 million for the dc x can t itself afford to fund full development of a follow on vehicle to get the necessary hundreds of millions required for this is a little peculiar way of putting it sdio s budget this year was what 3 4 billion they _could_ fund all of the dc development out of one years budget of course they do have other irons in the fire and launcher development is not their primary purpose but the dc development could as easily be paid for by diverting that money as by diverting the comparable sts ops budget oh and before the flames start i applaud the sdio for funding dc x devlopment and i hope it works and no launcher development is not nasas primary goal either imho they are supposed to provide the enabling technology research for others to do launcher development and secondarily operate such launchers as they require but that s just me

3 | brian yamauchi asks regarding orbital billboards well i had been collecting data for next edition of the commercial space news space technology investor to summarize space advertising first advertising on space vehicles is not new it is very common practice to put the cooperating organization s logos on the space launch vehicle for example the latest gps launcher had the very prominent logos on its side of mcdonnell douglas the delta launcher rockwell international who built the gps satellite usaf who paid for the satellite and launch and the gps navstar program office this has not been considered paid advertising but rather public relations since the restrictions have been such that only organizations involved in the launch could put their logos on the side and there was no money exchanged for this however putting a 10 high logo on the side of the launch vehicle facing the cameras is advertising as much as it is public relations in my opinion and by the way i note that the dc x test vehicle has rather prominent mcdonnell douglas and sdio logos on the side there have been several studies looking at the revenue potentials for use of space vehicles for advertising or placing large advertising signs in orbit on the shuttle for example i know of several serious studies in the early and mid 1980 s which looked at putting logos on the external tank or on the sides of the payload bay these ventures would be different than public relations in that the logos or displays would not be restricted to the firms participating on that flight and would involve payment of sums for the right to fly the logos in a prominent organization for example painting the et to look like a pepsi can or putting a disneyworld logo on the inside of the payload bay where the cameras would scan past it adverts on launch vehicles the first paid advertising was done on a soviet launcher in about 1990 when several non involved foreign organizations were allowed to pay to put their logos on a proton launch an italian shoe company was one of the first advertisers i remember similarly soviet cosmonauts on mir made a paid advertisement for the last olympic games and have gleefully shown banners and other items from participating firms and organizations mars candy bars for example got a plug from orbit as a sponsor of the launch of the british visiting cosmonaut to mir now us firms are starting to put paid advertisements on launch vehicles the upcoming conestoga launch in june putting the comet recoverable payload capsule into orbit will have paid advertisements on the side for arnold schwarzenegger s upcoming movie the last action hero besides the usual logos of the participating organizations columbia pictures has paid 500 000 to put ads on the main fuselage of the mission s conestoga rocket its booster rockets and on the comet payload which will orbit the earth for one month a concept for this advertising display was published in space news magazine a couple of months ago as a side note robert lorsch an advertising executive is talking about suing nasa he charges nasa with appropriating an idea he created with the space agency in 1981 to form corporate advertising sponsorships on nasa spacecraft as a way to get funding for the space program lorsch contends that in selling advertising space on the upcoming comet nasa violated an agreement that it would not use his idea without him being the exclusive representative for nasa and receiving compensation this is being disputed since the launch is a commercial launch and nasa is receiving none of the advertising revenues but the funding for the comet program is coming from nasa orbital billboards orbital billboards have been the staple of science fiction for some time arthur c clarke wrote about one example and robert heinlein described another in the man who sold the moon several different potential projects have been developed although none have been implemented but the most real prior to 1993 being the eiffel ii project which would have placed a large inflatable sculpture in orbit to celebrate the french republic s bi centennial cont

2 | obesssive compulsive disorder not to be confused with obsessive compulsive _personality_ disorder is an acute anxiety disorder characterized by either obsessions persistent intrusive thoughts that cause anxiety when not entertained or compulsions repetitive ritualistic actions that similarly cause intense psychological discomfort when resisted ocd is often associated with certain forms of depression examples of obsessive thoughts are repeated impulses to kill a loved one though not accompanied by anger or a religious person having recurrent blasphemous thoughts generally the individual attempts to ignore or suppress the intrusive thoughts by engaging in other activities the individual realizes that the thoughts originate from the own mind rather than being from an external source examples of compulsive actions are constant repetitive hand washing or other activity that is not realistically related to alleviating a source of the anxiety in ocd the obsessions or compulsions are highly distressing to the individual take an hour or more per day and significantly impair their daily routine and social relationships treatments include psychotherapy behavioral methods and sometimes certain anti depressants which have recently been found effective in alleviating obsessions and compulsions the standard diagnostic code for ocd if you want to look it up in the dsm iii manual of psychiatric diagnosis is 300 30 kind regards

3 | sei level 5 the highest level the sei stands for software engineering institute i m not sure but i believe that this rating only applies to the flight software also keep in mind that it was not achieved through the use of sophisticated tools but rather through a brute force and ignorance attack on the problem during the challenger standdown they simply threw hundreds of people at it and did the whole process by hand i would not consider receiving a warning status on systems which are not yet in use would detract much if anything from such a rating i ll have to get the latest copy of the guidelines to make sure they just issued new ones i think also keep in mind that the sei levels are concerned primarily with control of the software process the assumption is that a well controlled process will produce good software also keep in mind that sei level 5 is damned hard most software in this country is produced by engineering practicies that only rate an sei level 1 if that insisting on perfect safety is for people who don t have the balls to live in the real world mary shafer nasa ames dryden

2 | i may not be the world s greatest expert on chiggers a type of mite indigenous to the south but i certainly have spent a lot of time contemplating the little buggers over the past six years since we moved to n c here are some observations gained from painful experience 1 reactions to chiggers vary greatly from person to person some people get tiny red bites others like me are more sensitive and get fairly large swollen sore like affairs 2 chigger bites are the gift that keeps on giving i swear that these things will itch for months 3 there is a lot of folklore about chiggers i think most of it is fiction i have tried to do research on the critters since they have such an effect on me the only book i could find on the subject was a single book in unc s special collections library i have not yet gone through what is required to get it 4 based on my experience and that of my family members the old folk remedy of fingernail polish simply doesn t work i recall reading that the theory upon which it is based that the chiggers burrow into your skin and continue to party there is false i think it is more likely that the reaction is to toxins of some sort the little pests release but this is speculation 5 the best approach is prevention a couple of things work well a good insect repellent deet such as deep woods off liberally applied to ankles waistband etc is a good start there is another preparation called chig away that is a combination of sulfur and some kind of cream cortisone that originally was prepared for the army and is not commercially available in the summer i put this on my ankles every morning when i get up on weekends since i literally can t go outside where we live in the country without serious consequences they apparently don t like sulfur much at all you can use sulfur as a dust on your body or clothing to repel them 6 no amount of prevention will be completely successful forget the fingernail polish i have finally settled upon a treatment that involves topical application of a combination of cortisone creme reduces the inflamation and swelling and benzocaine relieves the itch i won t tell you all the things i ve tried nor will i tell you some of the things my wife does since this counts as minor surgery and is best not mentioned i also think it gains nothing 7 the swelling and itching can also be significantly relieved by the application of hot packs and this seems to speed recovery as well doctors seem not to care much about chiggers the urban and suburban doctors apparently don t encounter them much and the rural doctors seem to regard them as a force of nature that one must endure i suspect that anyone who could come up with a good treatment for chiggers would make a lot of money

3 | there is an interesting opinion piece in the business section of today s la times thursday april 15 1993 p d1 i thought i d post it to stir up some flame wars i mean reasoned debate let me preface it by saying that i largely agree that the space age in the romantic sense of several decades ago is over and that projects like the space station miss the point at this time reading for example what s new the weekly physics update we get here on the net it s clear that the romance of the day lies in the ever more fine grained manipulation of matter by which i include biotechnology condensed matter physics with its spinoffs in computer hardware and elsewhere and the amazing things people are doing with individual atoms these days to a large extent i think the romance some people still have with space is a matter of nostalgia i feel sure that someday we or more precisely our mind children will spread across space unless we wipe ourselves out but i think that manned space exploration is not what is exciting about what we can do now anyway let me quote some of this article but not all space age glory fades from view micheal schrage writer consultant and research associate at mit at 35 america s space age won t have to suffer through the angst of a midlife crisis the reason is that the space age is already dead the technologies no longer define our times and the public has grown weary of the multibillion dollar celestial investments that yield minimal psychic or economic rewards space exploration has mutated from a central focuse of america s science and technology debate into a peripheral issue speace is not a meaningful part of the ongoing industrial competitiveness debate our technology infrastructure discussions or even our defense conversion policy to be sure america should continue to invest in satellite technologies for telecommunications and remote sensing cheap deep space probes would be nice too but the ideal of space as a meaningful driver of scientific and industrial innovation is now dead before the change in administrations it would have been foolish to write an obituary for the space age the bush white house aggressively supported the space program and proposed spending well over 30 billion to build space station freedom alone even as he proposed budget cuts in other science and technology domains office of management and budget director richard darman was an outspoken public champion of big ticket space expenditures the reality that much of the civilian space program from the shuttle to the hubble telescope to the space station was poorly conceived and unimpressively implemented did not seem to matter much political inertia and a nostalgic sense of futurism not a coherent vision or cost effective sensibilities determined multibillion dollar space budgets indeed with few notable exceptions such as voyager the post apollo era is the story of the gold plated porkification of space exploration with programs and promises that delivered less for more and more while the clinton administration has kept on the highly regarded daniel goldin as administrator of the national aeronautics and space administration it seems clear that space exploration is not being positioned as either a symbolic or substantive centerpiece of america s technological prowess the space station budget has rightly been slashed space is virtually ignored when the administration champions its competitiveness agenda

3 | all of this talk about a commercial space race i e 1g to the first 1 year moon base is intriguing similar prizes have influenced aerospace development before the 25k orteig prize helped lindbergh sell his spirit of saint louis venture to his financial backers if memory serves the 25k prize would not have been enough to totally reimburse some of the more expensive transatlantic projects such as fokker s nungesser and other multi engine projects however lindbergh ultimately kept his total costs below that amount but i strongly suspect that his saint louis backers had the foresight to realize that much more was at stake than 25 000 could it work with the moon who are the far sighted financial backers of today

2 | a bit more than a year ago a hernia in my right groin was discovered it had produced a dull pain in that area the hernia was repaired using the least intrusive orthoscopic method and a plug and patch the doctor considered the procedure a success a few months later the same pain returned the doctor said that he could find nothing wrong in the area of the hernia repair now the pain occurs more often my gp couldn t identify any specific problem the surgen who performed the original procedure now says that yes there is a new hernia in the same area and he said that he has to cut into the area for the repair this time my question to the net is there a nonintrusive method to determine if in fact there is a hernia or if the pain is from something else

2 | as promised below is a personal critique of a pressure point massager i recently bought from the self care catalog i am very pleased with the results the catalog description is as follows the pressure point massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles much like a professional shiatsu masseur the powerful motor drives two counter rotating thumbs that move in one inch orbits releasing tension in the neck back legs and arms pressure point massager a2623 109 to order or receive a catalog call 24 hours 7 days 1 800 345 3371 or fax at 1 800 345 4021 note when i ordered the massager the item number was different and the price was 179 not 109 when i received it i glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one i was quite annoyed to see a 70 difference in price i called them about it and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers although it looks and works exactly the same he told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one using the price difference as a reason for return in fact since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory i received this one in 3 days he told me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrives then return the old one very reasonable people i have long term neck shoulder and back pain if i were a building i would be described as structurally unsound i have stretches and exercises to do that help but the problem never really goes away if for whatever reason i do not exercise for a while illness not enough time lazy etc the muscles become quite stiff and painful and thus more prone to further strain even with exercise i sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track which 1st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p t the tension in my neck if not released eventually causes a headache sometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye when my physical therapist has massaged my neck and the sub occipital muscles in particular the 2 knobby areas near the base of the skull the headache usually eased within a day although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged i ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishing someone would invent a machine that would massage not vibrate my neck and sub occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenient p t appts for a week later would be needed to use it i could get up in the middle of the night and use it if necessary i have been using it for about a week or so now and love it the base unit is about a 14 x 9 rectangle about 3 3 4 high with handles on each side and it plugs into an average outlet the two metal thumbs are about 1 1 2 in diameter and protrude about 2 1 2 above the base the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non removable they are located more toward one end rather than centered see figure below they move in either clockwise or counter clockwise directions depending on which side of the switch is pushed and are very quiet it can be used from either side for instance the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck depending on which direction you approach it _______________________________ __ _______________ __ _______________ __ __ _______________________________ for the neck head the user varies the amount of pressure used by if laying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and or neck to rest on the thumbs the handles can also be used if sitting or standing applying pressure with the arms wrists since my wrists are also impaired i m typing this over an extended period of time and i don t have someone living with me who can apply it laying down works well for me for my back i sit in a high backed kitchen chair position the massager behind me at whatever point i want massaged and lean back lightly or not so lightly against it the pressure of leaning back holds it in place if i want to massage the entire spine i simply move it down a few inches whenever i feel like it for my back this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used home made massager of 2 tennis balls taped together with the balls position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them the tennis balls are better than nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quads are not in good shape and my long hair gets painfully in the way if i don t pin it up first as far as i m concerned the easier something like this is to use the more likely i ll use do it if there are multiple considerations hassles i m more likely to not bother with it not only has this machine helped with my headaches but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased the first time i used it on my neck sub occipital muscles however i overdid it and pressed too hard against it which resulted in a very tender almost bruised area for a few days i laid off it for about 3 days and applied ice which helped after that i was more gradual about applying pressure at this point the pain in the sub occipital area is now minimal while being massaged i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back which is the most vulnerable point for me it also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades although again it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes at a time to really work it out i highly recommend this product if you have similar problems although i cannot vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy since i ve had it such a short time i plan to use it not only to ease tension but also to loosen the muscls before exercising and maybe after too i have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks so this was very timely for me this is the 1st product i ve ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co worker the catalog states they have been in business since 1976 it contains quite a few health care products and while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do definitely a step above some other ones i ve seen such as dr leonards health care catalog or mature wisdom i m only 37 but have ended up on some geriatric type mailing lists no big surprise here i consider many of those products to be rip offs particularly targeted toward the elderly with dubious health benefits i apologize for the length of this but it s the kind of info _i_ would like to know before ordering something thru the mail

1 | hello let me introduce a problem when i measure a sinusoidal wave voltage with a digital voltmeter using ac mode my output is an rms value a peak value over 2 squared right when i measure a square wave in the same mode ac my output is equal to a peak value actually to the upper flat boundary of the wave i assumed that a digital voltmeter makes some kind of integration of the input value and divides it over the wave period right now i used it to measure the same square wave as above but distorted by high frequency harmonics ideally output should be the same but the output value was only about 10 of the previous one why what is the nature of this output value what does the voltmeter actually measure and what does it show re rms readings unless the dvm says it s measuring rms it s probably average voltage the input is diode rectified and measured as dc if it says it s rms and but measures square triangle etc incorrectly it s measuring average and multipling by a correction that s only true for sine waves i e vave 0 707 0 63 vrms if you want correct rms for most any waveform you need a true rms dvm dmm which literally does the root mean square calculation in either analog or digital circuitry related question less important to me what are advantages and disadvantages of digital voltmeters to compare with analog ones the last significant advantage of analog imo was being able to see the signal if it was changing over time e g checking electrolytic capacitors anymore most dmm have bargraphs etc that duplicate this thank you for your attention you could mail me your opinion at avm1993 zeus tamu edu or open a discussion here i would appreciate either way alexander v mamishev ____________________________________________________________________________ power system automation laboratory phone office 409 845 4623 department of electrical engineering phone home 409 846 5850 texas a m university fax 409 862 2282 college station tx 77843 usa internet avm1993 zeus tamu edu

1 | imprecise this description 1 ignores the role of the ballast 2 misrepresents the heating effects in the starter the bimetalic strip cools down immediately after the contacts short circuit because the neon discharge stops and much less heat is generated from the i 2r loss in the metal as compared to the neon discharge the starter contacts open before the tube fires actually the tube fires as a result of the back emf generated in the ballast because of this immediate opening of the starter s contacts a capacitor is connected in parallel with the contacts to prevent excessive arcing during the firing the neon reionizes but does not draw sufficient current to prevent firing of the tube itself

1 | allmartin mccormickwhat s exactly in a flour mm from martin datacomm ucc okstate edu martin mccormick mm organization oklahoma state university stillwater ok mm what sort of lamp is the little glass bulb found inside the starter mm it sort of reminds me of a ne2 neon lamp starters appear open when m mm with an ohm meter so the little lamp is either a neon or has a capacit mm in series with it mm mm i have seen these things all my life but never read a really good mm description of what is happening inside that little can do you know what a bi metallic strip is just in case it is two strips of different metals bonded together which when heated bend to one side check out the blinker globe in your christmas tree lights so when you turn on the power this causes the bulb to work like a neon heating up and shorting out thus providing a loop to power the heaters in the main tube when the tube fires insufficient current runs through the starter to keep the heat up and the bi metalic strip straightens out o c btw i too thought that they were nothing more than a small neon so one day when the neon in my sisters digital flip the metal squares type clock broke flimsy leads i replaced it with one from a starter well powering up made a bit of a mess of the clock

1 | in article 1ptolq p7e werple apana org au petert zikzak apana org au peter just a thought of mine here since an on hook line is aprox 48 50v and off hook it usually drops below 1 how about an led in series with a zener say around 30v on hook led on off hook led off would this work if anyone tries tried it please let me know aye there s the rub if you draw enough current to light an led the equipment at the phone company will think you ve gone off hook in the on hook state you re not supposed to draw current which means you should just use your digital voltmeter you can use an old vom but the phone company equipment can detect that and might think there s something wrong with the cable look guys what s the problem here if you want a light that goes on when the phone is off hook all you need it to run it in series with the line as i mentioned in my previous post if you want a light that goes on when the phone is on hook all you need is a voltage threshold detector if you re going to do the series diode thing which is the easiest just make sure that the led can take the current i can t recall it off hand but it s something like 100ma or more greggo

3 | the gravity maneuvering that was used was to exploit fuzzy regions these are described by the inventor as exploiting the second order perturbations in a three body system the probe was launched into this region for the earth moon sun system where the perturbations affected it in such a way as to allow it to go into lunar orbit without large expenditures of fuel to slow down the idea is that natural objects sometimes get captured without expending fuel we ll just find the trajectory that makes it possible the originator of the technique said that nasa wasn t interested but that japan was because their probe was small and couldn t hold a lot of fuel for deceleration this from an issue of science news or the planetary report i believe about 2 months ago

2 | well yes that was a part of my point aspirin has its problems but in some situations it is useful ditto stuff like licorice root taking anything as a drug for theraputic purposes implicitly carries the idea of taking a dose where the benefits are not exceeded by any unwanted additional effects taking any drug when the potential ill effects are not known is a risk assumed by the parties involved and it may be that in a given situation the risk is worthwhile like prozac for instance prozac has been shown to be theraputic in some cases where the tri cyclics fail but prozac hasn t been in use that long and it really isn t clear what if any effects it may have when taken over long periods of time even though it has been tested by present day standards should prozac be taken off the market because long term effects if any are not known imho i d say no euclid

3 | in reference to the limits of acceleration with guns launching solid rockets as payloads thiokol provided me with samples and data on a reinforcement to solid motor grains for high accelerations solid motor propellants usually have a substantial percentage of aluminum in the mix for example the space shuttle srbs are 16 percent aluminum the technique is to use a foamed aluminum structure the structure looks like the inverse of a set of bubbles an i suspect some bubbling process is used to form it in other words if you made a bunch of bubbles in molten aluminum then froze it this is what you get it forms a strong network of effectively aluminum wires in all directions the remaining solid fuel mix is infiltrated into the voids and you get aluminum reinforced solid propellant the foamed aluminum makes up about 6 percent of the total propellant so there is still aluminum particles in the bulk grain the major improvement is the higher resistance to grain cracking which is the principal failure mode for solid propellant dani eder

1 | it is illegal to use anything you eavedropped on for a business or for an illegal use jurisdictions that ban radar detectors or police monitors are essentially making the claim that there is no other reason for a radar detector or police radio monitor the results of fighting these claims in courts have been mixed the federal courts are not anxious to intervene and state courts have sometimes held that the feds have exclusive jurisdiction and sometimes they have not a lot of state courts do not have enough imagination to see any use for a radar detector besides avoiding law enforcement action for speeding when you buy a radar detector amongst the guarrantees instructions explanations and other detritus is an invitation to join an association dedicated to preserving your right to use a radar detector i promise i am not making this up i do not think radar detector manufacturers would be making any headway at all in courtrooms if police departments enforced speed laws with a strict eye to public safety and a blind eye to the fund raiser aspect of tickets

2 | to start with no methodology or form of reasoning is infallible so there s a question of how much certainty we are willing to pay for in a given context insistence on too much rigor bogs science down completely and makes progress impossible expenditure of sufficiently large sums of money and amounts of time can sometimes overcome this on the other hand with too little rigor much is lost by basing work on results which eventually turn out to be false there is a morass of studies contradicting other studies and outsiders start saying you people call this science my opinion for what it s worth is that one sees both these phenomena happening simultaneously in some parts of psychology some subjective judgement is required to decide on the level of rigor appropriate for a particular investigation i don t believe it is ever possible to banish subjective judgement from science my second point though is that highly capable people can often make extremely reliable judgements about scientific validity even when using methodology considered inadequate by the usual standards i think this is true of many scientists and i think it is true of many who approach their discipline in a way that is not generally recognized as scientific within mathematics i think there are several examples especially before the twentieth century one conspicuous case is that of riemann who is famous for many theorems he stated but did not prove later mathematicians did prove them of course i think that for a good scientist empirical investigation is often not so much a matter of determining what is true and what s not as it is a matter of convincing other people people have proposed lots of incompatible definitions of science here but i think the ability to objectively convince others of the validity of one s results is an essential element not that one can necessarily do that at every step of the scientific process but i think that if one is not moving toward that goal then one is not doing science when a person other than a scientist is quite good at what he does and seems to be very successful at it i think that his judgements are also worthy of respect and that his assertions are well worth further investigation admittedly my question was not at all well posed a considerable amount of effort in a serious scholarly investigation such as i suggested would be required simply to formulate an appropriately specific question to try and answer the science i was thinking of in my question is the actual science currently practiced now in the last decade of the twentieth century i certainly wasn t thinking of some idealized science or the mere use of reason and observation one thing i had in mind in my suggestion was the question as to whether in many cases the subjective judgements of skilled and experienced practitioners might be more reliable than statistical studies since russell turpin seems to be much more familiar than i am with the study of scientific methodology perhaps he can tell us if there is any existing research related to this question in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

2 | as usual you are missing the whole point russell because you are not willing to even consider questionning your basic article of faith which is that science is merely a matter of methodology and that the highest purpose of science is to avoid making mistakes this is like saying that the most important aspect of business management is accurate bookkeeping if science were no more than methodology and not making mistakes it would be a poor thing indeed what was the methodology of darwin what was the methodology of einstein what was for that matter the methodology of jenner and pasteur first of all i think you are arguing against a straw man because i don t think that anyone here is arguing that quackery pseudo science homeopathy chiropracty and traditional chinese medicine should be accepted as science i in particular think the basic ideas of homeopathy and chiropracty seem extremely flaky what some of us do believe however is that some of these things including some of the flaky ideas are deserving of serious scientific attention if in fact it were true as you have stated above that those who do not use the currently fashionable methodology can have no idea what is effective and what is not then science today would not exist for all of current science is based on the past work of scientists whose methodology by current standards was seriously flawed it is certainly true that as methodology improves we need to re examine those results derived in the past using less perfect methodologies it is also true that the results obtained by people today who still rely on those early methodologies needs to be re examined in a more rigorous fashion by those qualified to do so credibly but to say that nobody who fails to do elaborate double blind studies is capable of knowing their ass from a hole in the ground and to say that no ideas that come from outside the scientific establishment could possibly be worthy of serious investigation this truly marks one s attitude as doctrinaire cultist this attitude is not compatible with a belief in reason in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

1 | here s a rough sketch of how the system works a reference station with a very exactly known position computes the errors in the incoming gps signals these errors are due to several factors including atmospheric distortion sa selective availability time dithering etc the reference unit contains complex computational equipment to back out the errors in its position since it knows where it is already it then transmits these corrections on a broadcast which is available to any number of relatively local receivers if the receivers are nearby 300km and are using the same satellites as the reference unit the errors should be very similar for the reference unit and the receiver unit thus the receiver unit may apply the corrections calculated by the reference unit the us coast guard is currently as far as i know installing a series of coastline transmitters for differential gps these stations will use existing radio towers i believe the frequency is to be approximately 305 khz there are many other private corporations offering dgps signals on different frequencies for example pinpoint 310 618 7076 offers correction signals and receiver units using an fm broadcast system which has stations all across the us the correction codes are usually transmitted using the rtcm 104 format advertised accuracies espouse 1 to 5 meter errors john p baker my opinions are my own i don t know johns hopkins university anyone else who wants them anyway applied physics laboratory laurel md 20723 bakerjp1 aplcomm jhuapl edu

3 | excerpts from posting on this topic i ve seen satellites at midnight they re not only in twilight o now my comments i d like to add that some of the protests do not come from a strictly practical consideration of what pollution levels are acceptable for research activities by professional astronomers some of what i would complain about is rooted in aesthetics many readers may never have known a time where the heavens were pristine sacred unsullied by the actions of humans the space between the stars as profoundly black as an abyss can be with full horizons and a pure sky one could look out upon half of all creation at a time none of which had any connection with the petty matters of man any lights were supplied solely by nature uncorruptable by men whole religions were based on mortal man somehow getting up there and becoming immortal as the stars whether by apotheosis or a belief in an afterlife the space age changed all that the effect of the first sputniks and echo etc on this view could only happen once to see a light crossing the night sky and know it was put there by us puny people is still impressive and the sense of size one gets by assimilating the scales involved is also awesome even if the few hundreds or thousands of miles involved is still dwarfed by the rest of the universe but there is still a hunger for the pure beauty of a virgin sky yes i know aircraft are almost always in sight i have to live in a very populated area 6 miles from an international airport currently where light pollution on the ground is ghastly the impact of humans is so extreme here virtually no place exists that has not been shaped sculpted modified trashed or whipped into shape by the hands of man in some places the only life forms larger than bacteria are humans cockroaches and squirrels or rats i visited some friends up in the appalacian mountains one weekend getting away from it all paved roads indoor plumbing malls and it felt good for a while then i quickly noticed the hollow was directly under the main flight path into dulles 60 80 miles to the east their security light didn t help matters much either but i ve heard the artic wilderness gets lots of high air traffic so i know the skies are rarely perfect but there is still this desire to see a place that man hasn t fouled in some way i mean they ve been trying this forever like concerning tesla s idea to banish night wow i don t watch commercial television but i can imagine just how disgusting beer truck or hemmorrhoid ointment advertisements would be if seen up so high if ya gotta make a buck on it displaying products in heaven at least consider the reactions from those for whom the sky is a last beautiful refuge from the baseness of modern life to be open about this though i have here my listing of the passage of hst in the evening sky for this weekend tonight friday at 8 25 p m edt it will reach an altitude of 20 1 degrees on the local meridian from baltimore vicinity i ll be trying to see it if i can it _is_ my mealticket after all so i suppose i could be called an elitist for supporting this intrusion on the night sky while complaining about billboards proposed by others be that as it may i think my point about a desire for beauty is valid even if it can t ever be perfectly achieved

2 | i think we agree on much however the paragraphs above seem to repeat uncritically the standard kuhn lakatos feyerabend view of progress and rationality in science since i ve addressed these issues in this newsgroup in the not too distant past i won t go into them again now what is wrong with the above observation is that it explicitly gives the impression and you may not in fact hold this view that the common perhaps even the correct approach for a scientist to follow is to sit around having flights of fancy and scheming on the basis of his jealousies and petty hatreds it further at least implicitly advances the position that sciences goes forward and it is not clear what this means given the context in which it occurs by generating in a completely non rational and even random way a plethora of hypotheses and theories that are then weeded out via the critical function of science though why this critical function should be less subject to the non rational forces is a mystery if experimental design hypotheses creation and theory construction are subject to jealousies and petty hatreds then this must be equally true of the application of any critical function concerning replication this is what leads one ala feyerabend to an anything goes view true the generation part can be totally irrational but typically it is not anecdotes concerning instances where a hypothesis seems to have resulted in some way from a dream or from one s political views simply do not generalize well to the actual history of science

2 | whether a scientific idea comes while one is staring out the window or dreaming or having a fantasy or watching an apple fall newton or sitting in a bath archimedes it is ultimately the result of a lot of intense scientific thinking done beforehand letting one s mind roam freely and giving rein to one s intuition can be a useful way of coming up with new ideas but only when one has done a lot of rational analysis of the problem first scientific intuition is not something one is born with it is something that one learns maybe we don t understand completely how it is learned but training in systematic scientific thinking is certainly one of the key elements in developing it informal exploration is also often an important element in finding new scientific ideas one thinks for instance of darwin s naturalistic studies in the galapagos islands which led him to the ideas for the theory of evolution this is why i am offended by a definition of science that emphasizes empirical verification and does not recognize thinking and informal exploration as important scientific work i agree that mere speculation does not deserve to be called science i also think that mere empirical studies not directed by good scientific thinking are at best a very poor kind of science i don t think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science namely thinking and informal exploration are not recognized as scientific work in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing religious sects

department of commerce projects us commercial space sales will remain flat in 1993 with current data showing only a 2 percent growth over 1992 as published in us industrial outlook 1993 which was released in january revenues from the 1993 us space business are currently projected to be about 4 890 m in contrast to previous years when us commercial space sales had shown double digits growth rates this year s projected results are driven by the us satellite manufacturing industry where sales are projected to drop from 12 satellites worth 1 300 m in 1992 to 7 satellites worth 670 m in 1993 the us industrial outlook also projects u s commercial launchers faces flat demand in coming year and while predicting that 1993 revenues will increase 10 percent to 450 m future sales will be adversely affected by the downward revision in department of defense launch plans offsetting flat launch revenues and satellite deliveries revenues for fixed and mobile satellite services are projected to increase to 1 900 m primarily driven by increased revenues from broadcast and cable tv networks similarly remote sensing products and sales are projected to increase to 250 m in 1993 up

microgravity research lab 60 total annual revenues 2 715 3 385 4 220 4 815 4 890 r revised data for 1992 e estimated data for 1993 commentary this is the first look at how the us commercial space industry is expected to do in 1993 in general not a bad report with most of the bad news concentrated in the satellite manufacturing area there changes of only a few satellites worth 100 m or so apiece can substantially influence the annual projection if we look forward over several years this market sector should retain strong sales as us firms have been very successful in regaining international market share in the satellite business furthermore sales of satellite ground equipment should go up in the next revision of this data expected to be released about mid year data on mobile satellite ground equipment sales including such items as gps receivers and portable satellite terminals appears to be missing from the january data set doc usually publishes a listing of space business indicators in mid year and the next revision of commercial space revenues should be released then i expect the revised revenues should easily top 5 000 m if the mobile satellite ground equipment are added back into the numbers and the year should show about a 10 overall market growth looking beyond this year s data future markets look quite promising the doc projects satellite service revenues could top 3 000 m by 1995 if new mobile satellite services and direct broadcasting are implemented as planned and that mobile satellite station sales are expected to continue to growth at 15 20 per year through the mid 1990 s my numbers are somewhat more pessimistic for near term market growth but i agree the trend should be for substantial growth in us commercial space sales over at least the next 5 10 years my pessimism is due to more conservative assumptions on market capture and growth in leo communications and satellite direct broadcasting services i don t believe all of the current players in the yet to be born leo communications satellite market and in the yet to be proven direct broadcasting market will be financial successes nor that sales growth will be as explosive as currently projected it should also be noted this year s doc data is the first release to show revenues from privately funded microgravity research facilities the 60 m shown in the janurary data is primarily for the spacehab module planned for launch in april on the space shuttle but also hidden in these numbers are the projected first sales from the comet orbital launch and recovery experiment module 2 delta wins two key launch contracts mcdonnell douglas corporation which builds and markets the delta launch vehicle has won two important launch contracts motorola inc announced in mid february that it had selected the delta to launch most of the satellites in the 66 satellite iridium leo communications constellation and in mid april mcdonnell douglas was awarded the usaf medium launch vehicle iii contract the launch services contract with motorola for the iridium constellation launch is for at launch of least 45 iridium satellites another 21 satellites have been contracted to be launched by khrunichev enterprise in russian on 3 proton vehicle launches these 45 satellites planned for the delta will be launched 5 at a time providing for at least 9 launches additional satellites in the iridium constellation such as a planned on orbit spares may also be launched on delta although details of the launch services contract were reported to be negotiation and not yet final the usaf mlv contract also went to mdc bidding a variant of their delta ii launcher this contract is only initially worth 7 5 million but establishes a set of launch options for up to 36 launches encompassing launches from 1996 through 2002 these launches will deploy the next generation of the usaf s global positioning system block iir navigation satellites plus other programs first option for to meet the usaf launch options is expected to be exercised this year after which the usaf is expected to request launches of up to 6 deltas per year for at least 6 years under this contract the usaf can also request launch on demand services from mdc for the 1996 2002 time period with a launch to occur within 40 days of the request commentary if these two contracts are fulfilled they should provide an excellent business base for mdc s delta launch program through the turn of the century combined these two contracts have a potential for about 45 launches worth about 2 200 m to mdc and sustaining a core business base of 300 400 m year other contracts for international and commercial payloads as well as for nasa medium elv class payloads will add to this business base keeping mdc as a viable commerical launch company however it should be noted there are risk elements in these contracts motorola s iridium leo communications constellation has not yet received a us federal communications commission license for operation in the u s nor has motorola lined up all the financing and financial partners for the iridium venture without these approvals or financial backing there will be no iridium launches but hopefully these uncertainties will be settled this year similarly the usaf mlv iii program has been the target of several congressional actions which have slowed the production of the gps block iir satellites and deleted the funding for the mlv iii program in favor of the usaf nls spacelifter program at this time while it appears the mlv iii contract will be executed future funding for the mlv iii and other usaf commercial launch contracts is being reconsidered as part of national space launch strategy reviews some opinions expressed from within the administration and congress propose cancellation of all elv upgrade programs including the mlv programs in favor of the proposed spacelifter program such opinions may have some weight in this year s budget deliberations particularly as dod funds will be more difficult to find in the shrinking us defense budget 3 commercial remote sensing venture gets doc go ahead the first commercial license to operate a remote sensing satellite was approved in early february by the us department of commerce s office of space commerce a license was granted to worldview imaging corporation of oakland california to build and operate a pair of leo imaging satellites to provide multi spectral images of the earth commentary there has been little data released on this venture by worldview and the doc other than the announcement of the operating and construction license this was reported to be at the request of worldview most industry speculation identifies this new venture as a star wars spinoff using sdi type technology to provide digital earth sensing data and heavily integrated into digital gis databases for remote sensing gis users most probable customers for this service include exploration geologists agricultural planners and urban planners it is noteworthy this is the first commercial venture under the 1992 land remote sensing policy act the act as passed last november provides that remote sensing data gathered from private remote sensing craft may be sold to users at differing prices prior to this act remote sensing data from all satellites had to be sold to all users at the same prices and private remote sensing ventures would have had to sell at the government set landsat data prices there are rumors of several other potential commercial remote sensing ventures working their way through the system at different stages of development i think the large landsat and spot satellite systems will provide the majority of the satellite remote sensing data market for the next decade or so in contrast to these large government sponsored remote sensing systems smaller market ventures such as worldview and others can exploit market niches and use innovative technology and i believe can find profitability on the margin i predict there may be some very interesting ventures appearing in the next year or so 4 investment firm calls gd s space biz still a good investment wall street investment house morgan stanley thinks general dynamic s space systems division could still be a moneymaker despite having failed in the last 3 atlas launches in a recent analyst s report morgan stanley said we are more than ever convinced that if the company can return the atlas to its historical 95 plus success rate this will become a highly profitable cash generating unit based upon discussions with gd s corporate management morgan stanley projects that if the atlas problems are cleared up the unit could see 70 m in earnings per year by 1995 and 100 m per year by 2000 this is based upon gd s projection of capturing about 10 atlas launches per year on the world market commentary three failures in a row of their launch system has hurt general dynamic s space systems division since gd has restructured to only keep a very few profitable core businesses many market pundits have been speculating gd s space business might be next to be sold the morgan stanley report indicates gd s space systems division has some potential as a moneymaker despite current problems if they can get their act together sales are projected to be about 560 m in 1993 which will probably generate a loss of about 25 m if gd can capture their projected share of the space launch market and if they have managed to clean up the reliability of their atlas launchers then they could generate healthy profits from those sales but until they demonstrate the atlas centaur program is back on track this division will continue to show substantial losses in response to the sell off rumors in my opinion this operation is not a really good candidate for takeover and quick profitability to do such a takeover the current set corporate and divisional management would be replaced with another set from outside the firm in gd ssd s case to get the division back on track the management team will have to concentrate hard on the technical problems with the atlas centaur as well as in selling atlas services this would indicate only another firm with experience in rocket launch operations could find such talent in house and be able to convince customers to buy their launch services optimally the firm would have substantial liquid rocket experience and experience in marketing space technology internationally as well candidates for this might be trw rockwell lockheed and martin and possibly mcdonnell douglas and boeing but most of those firms have cash flow problems mdc have had a substantial business contraction boeing and mdc are involved with other launch firms lockheed or have taken on substantial debt martin and coming up with the 700 1500 m purchase price for the division is a big chunk of change for any company 5 ariane predicts dip in launch demand arianespace the operator of the ariane launch system is projecting a dip in launch demand in the late 1990 s in early february arianespace released their annual market survey which detailed their projection of the space transportation market for the next decade over short run arianespace expects to retain their dominant position and sustain a majority share of the launch market of 54 international and commercial launches planned through 1995 ariane holds contracts for 31 general dynamics atlas vehicle holds 14 contracts mcdonnell douglas delta holds 7 and great wall s long march vehicle holds 2 launch contracts three quarters of future launch contracts for which ariane can compete are projected to come from communications satellites with the remaining 25 split between weather earth observation and scientific satellites most of the future telecommunications demand growth is predicted to come from the asia pacific region arianespace expects the current market consolidation of individual satellite operators into regional or national groups will continue with these groups investing in heavier satellites with larger communications payloads carrying more transponders arianespace predicts the average mass of telecommunications satellites should increase by 20 over today s average level to about 3000 kg in geo demand for commercial launch services is expected to remain strong over the next three years but in the second half of the decade arianespace predicts demand will decrease arianespace bases this prediction upon a matching of satellite transponder demand and supply particularly as new data compression techniques appear to could double or triple transponder capacity using existing or near term transponders one of the significant possible changes in the market was identified as the arrival of new launch vehicles including russian launch systems but arianespace predicts that in the long term investors purchasing launch services are looking for the best trade off between launch service quality and price and that russian and other new launch services will have to prove out their capabilities and service quality and their market penetration will be minimal commentary ariane releases their market surveys annually and i reported on their prior market survey in a past issue of csn sti comparing the two surveys there aren t outstanding differences in the numbers the most notable change is the consideration of new data compression techniques reducing the demand for new physical transponders on orbit i note that in contrast to some predictions demand for space based communications transponders appears to be remain strong while fiber optic lines are making substantial inroads into the established point to point telecommunications markets growing demand for telecommunications services world wide and for point to multipoint broadcast services have prevented a decrease in space transponder demand fiberoptic cables provide a higher capability service but only from established point a to established point b to establish a fiberoptic link it is necessary to install cable between the points and while there are improved network solutions installing a large network of distributed fiberoptic links can cost millions or billions of dollars for broadcast services where there is not an existing ground network structure satellites still offer the most cost effective solution and if new services are required into a new region it is cheaper to install a small satellite link costing only a few tens of thousands of dollars and tie into the existing global satellite network this allows rapid growth of new satellite services and has kept demand high the replacement market for fiberoptics is growing as well since as demand grows between the points serviced it becomes cost effective to later install a fiberoptic link to handle the increase in traffic since the telecommunications and data transfer markets are still growing rapidly satellite market projections remain rosy but satellites are also getting longer orbital lifetimes current generation satellites are now getting guarantees of at 15 years of on orbit service or more in contrast to 10 years of service from last generation s satellites this has cut back some of the launch demand as satellite owners are rescheduling replacement satellite launches over longer intervals and as last note arianespace didn t flag it this year but it looks like the space transportation market will be rather over supplied by existing launch systems in the near term the annual commercial launch demand is for about 15 20 medium sized satellites per year from the supply side ariane is capable of launching up to about a dozen medium sized satellites a year delta is capable of about 9 12 per year atlas is capable of 6 12 long march 4 8 japan s h vehicle 2 4 russia s proton capable of 8 and other systems such as zenit and soyuz another 10 20 medium launches per year that s a lot of capability for a small market we can only expect the competition to intensify for commercial launches 6 ntsb investigates pegasus launch over aborted abort the 9 feb pegasus launch by orbital sciences corporation has spawned an investigation over an apparent violation of range safety rules a valid abort order from a nasa range safety officer to halt the mission was overridden and the pegasus was launched in violation of range safety rules in the last few minutes of the pegasus launch countdown one of two abort command receivers aboard the pegasus failed such a failure typically scrubs a launch and a nasa range safety officer at wallops island va issued a mission abort order about a minute before the scheduled pegasus launch somehow this command was overridden by the osc launch team or the message was lost in the communications channels and the pegasus was launched despite the valid abort call fortunately the pegasus functioned as expected and the abort command receiver was not needed but this incident did spark an investigation since a valid abort order was given under agreed to launch constraint rules and was not obeyed leading the investigation is the national transportation safety board ntsb with support from nasa osc and the air force this investigation marks the first time ntsb has taken the lead on an incident involving a space launch according to the ntsb their investigation will take about 6 months and is primarily looking at lines of authority communications links and safety procedures used in the launch commentary this is the first time that the ntsb has led an investigation into a space launch their leadership was requested by the department of commerce s office of commercial space transportation who had licensed the commercial launch at the time of writing this column some of the initial investigations have been concluded and some of the results are starting to leak out into the trade press apparently 3 or four different communications channels were in use during the test after the abort destruct receiver stopped responding the nasa test director and range controller in the mission control room at wallops island gave abort orders about a minute before the launch according to the mission rules this should have stopped the launch somehow the osc test conductor ordered the abort reversed and the nasa communicator on the net relayed that order to the b 52 carrying the pegasus at about 22 seconds before launch differing explainations of exactly how this happened are proposed with the best set being that clear lines of communications and clear definition of the responsibilities of the mission control team and understanding of the mission rules were not established before the launch as we see more and more commercial launches more of these procedural issues are going to crop up and will have to be resolved this case is interesting because it is the first time the ntsb has been called in to investigate a commercial launch problem as they do with commercial aircraft problems i think this problem will turn out to be primarily problems with procedures and communications and will be cleared up with issuance of guidelines on how launch communications should be set up and how specific lines of authority should be delineated 7 another pegasus competitor is announced tsniimach enterprise in russia announced it is marketing a new small space launch system based upon converted icbm components two versions of the launcher are being marketed the aerokosmos winged vehicle launched like the osc pegasus and the severkosmos launched from a mobile ground transporter the aerokosmos is projected to deliver 900 kg to a 200 km circular orbit or 580 kg to an 800 km circular orbit and the severkosmos to be capable of 430 kg to 200 km orbits and 225 kg to 800 km also proposed to be used with these launch systems is a leo data relay system called sineva tsniimach enterprise is described as a ex military establishment focusing on aerodynamics and thermal protection of spacecraft and which has participated in the development of the buran shuttle system they are located near the npo energia facility in kaliningrad outside of moscow commentary there s very little released information on this new venture my suspicion is it is another russian enterprise looking for hard currency and trying to capitalize upon their in house knowledge of ex soviet launch systems it adds to the list of numerous commercial space startups announced from the ex soviet union this one s a little different in that they are offering variants of ex soviet icbms but i can t identify any key customers being targeted or substantial financial backing 8 georgia launch site dropped from planning in late january georgia tech research institute released the results of a preliminary study on the feasibility of a commercial rocket launching site in camden county georgia at the old kingsland missile test launching site on the atlantic coast the preliminary study recommended the site not be pursued as a commercial launch site stating reopening the site was not feasible due to projected low investment returns plus environmental and other geographic considerations however the report did say the site might be ideal for other aerospace uses and recommended other potential uses commentary this should put the nails in the coffin of the kingsland commercial launch site while other sites are still proceeding with commercial launch site development plans kingsland found without a key customer to act as anchor tenant and if substantial infrastructure had to be put in then the expected returns were too low to justify the cost of development this might point out some key discriminators in judging the feasibility of a commercial launch site these include is there an identified key customer to provide core usage sufficient to recover setup costs is there a market advantage of using the site can existing infrastructure be used or modified at the site can financing be found at low enough cost to support the investment other commercial launch site ventures including those at woomera poker flat cape york white sands alabama off shore platform hawaii and vandenberg have to also be judged against these criteria in my opinion some of these ventures are flying on hope and speculation and not on sound financial grounds 9 spain s capricornia launcher still proceeding in one of his last official acts former president bush authorized space technology transfer for several joint space ventures between us and other firms one of these was a proposed use of us technology by spain to build a small booster with that regulatory impediment removed the 3 stage capricornia launch vehicle will start development later this year planning for a first launch in the 1995 96 time period the capricornia is described as a small 3 stage all solid booster designed to put 250 500 kg into leo several launch sites are being examined for the system including 2 on the iberian peninsula and 1 on the canary islands originated by inta in spain the project reports it has 30 m in development funding and will use technology from argentina s condor launch vehicle as well as from the us commentary several firms have identified a market opportunity in providing a small launcher for the european market small payloads from european firms or organizations currently use either ariane piggyback launches or the us italian scout launcher however ariane piggyback opportunities are limited and the scout program is being phased out accompanied by some disarray in the italian government and space industry regarding any follow on system this has left an apparent niche for a new european small launch system surprisingly enough esa has not supported development of such a system within the current space funding structure studies have been performed by british aerospace aerospatiale deutsche aerospace and italian organizations but with the exception of the swedish pacastro system reported below i have not been able to find any other european development work with even a rumor of funding for hardware also of interest is the linking of the capricornia to the argentinian condor launcher there have been some interesting rumors surfacing out of argentina over the past year about a space launcher irbm program funded under the military junta which ruled the country in the 1970 s and early 1980 s what is known is in feb 1992 the argentinian air force formally transferred control of the condor 2 missile program to the new civilian argentinian national space agency comison nacional de atividades espaciales cnae the condor 2 program was described as originating in 1983 expanding upon the smaller condor 1 rocket program in collaboration with egypt and with support of german firms the condor 2 was also reportedly funded indirectly by iraq in the mid 1980 s fairly large solid rocket motors were built and tested but argentinan development of a suitable guidance package lagged that of the propulsion system it should be noted cnae is planning to launch its first scientific satellite in late 1994 the us 9 m 181 kg sac b satellite will study the earth s upper atmosphere and includes cooperative experiments from italy and the us no launch vehicle has yet been selected but osc s pegasus and the russian burlak air launched rocket are reported to be strong contenders for this contract 10 pacastro signs launch reservation with swedish space corp pacastro a small launch firm in herndon virginia announced in late february it had received a 6 m launch reservation contract from the swedish space corp to launch a satellite on pacastro s pa 2 launch vehicle this will be performed as part of the polar satellite service pss a joint norwegian space center swedish space corp program to upgrade the andoya rocket range in norway and offering small satellite launches into the polar regions according to pacastro pss is also performing an 8 m upgrade of the andoya launch facilities including a new integration facility and a fully enclosed vertical assembly building for small launch vehicles like the pacastro pa 2 pacastro has been chosen as the main alternative rocket supplier for the small satellite launch service to be offered by pss from andoya the date of the launch of the swedish satellite was not specified commentary pacastro has been trying to line up customers and funding for their launch vehicle for some time now the pa 2 is a small two stage rocket fueled by rp 1 and liquid oxygen from pacastro s literature the engines designed for the pa series rockets are built of off the shelf components based upon the lunar module descent engines built by trw and are capable of putting a 225 kg satellite into a 750 km circular polar orbit pacastro is trying to arrange construction financing for its first three pa 2 vehicles with a first launch planned for 1995 and 2 orbital launches planned for 1996 my records show pacastro hired trw to provide marketing support and systems design with primary engineering to be done by aeroastro a small satellite builder closely associated with pacastro headquartered in the same building the swedish space corporation would supply engineering launch operations vehicle subsystems and marketing support sumitomo corp of tokyo is a first round investor and sits on the board of directors pacastro has gotten a first round financial package of at least 550 k some sources place this of high as 1 m but has been searching for about a year for the additional 20 30 m needed to design build and launch their first set of vehicles the launch reservation from ssc can possibly be used to help bring some investors on board but by my estimate they will need much more than the single 6 m sale to put their venture into real hardware 11 china and taiwan joint satellite venture reported in early march it was reported a joint satellite communications venture between a taiwanese and mainland chinese was in the works as reported in the taipei press china development corp cdc headquartered in taiwam and with links to the ruling nationalist party is planning to set up a joint venture in hong kong with china great wall industry corp with the objective of launching a regional communications satellite cdc would cover about 10 of the satellite system cost us 10 m in exchange for rights to 10 of the satellite s communications channels commentary this announcement came close on the heels of the release of taiwanese plans for space development released in mid january in those plans the national space program office of taiwan will launch 3 satellites starting with rocsat 1 a 400 kg scientific spacecraft planned for launch in 1997 two additional satellites are planned both communications satellites trw has been helping taiwan plan this program budgeted at t 13 6 b us 530 m through 2006 i haven t been able to establish any relationship between this venture and those of the nspot but there might be a connection while taiwan has the financing to pursue several ventures the current taiwanese telecommunications market might not support two separate sastellite ventures the reported name for the tiawanese chinese system is asiasat 2 but i don t thinks this has any relationship with the existing hong kong based asiasat program involving chinese hong kong and other asian investors other than using it as an organizational model there are some obvious advantages to pursuing such a joing venture it could provide excellent first hand experience to taiwan for a very low cost which then can be used in later satellite ventures but there are internal political issues between taiwanese and chinese ventures but putting any joint venture through a hong kong intermediary corporation might allow it to proceed in any case the east asian satellite market is lighting up with substantially growth projected in space services and revenues this is just another indicator to add to the list 12 south korea announces national move into space technologies south korea s trade industry and resources ministry recently announced plans to invest us 22 b in research and development and another us 17 b into manufacturing and research facilities for advanced aerospace technologies space technologies have been specifically targeted as part of this program beginning with manufacture and launch of an advanced multi purpose satellite by 1997 the objective of this investment is to raise south korea s aerospace technology to the level of the world s top 10 countries by 2000 commentary south korea has been quietly working to develop its national aerospace industry specifically including space activities i m noting this as a flag that potential new players are coming into the commercial space market as part of their national effort 2 national telecommunications satellites for korea telecom will be launched in april and oct 1995 on delta designated koreasat 1 and 2 the platforms will provide television and telephone service throughout the korean peninsula southwestern japan and portions of china bordering north korea south korea launched its first small satellite piggyback on ariane in aug 1992 called uribyol 1 our star and costing about us 8 8 m uribyol 2 is planned for piggyback launch in october of this year again on ariane and will be entirely made in korea uribyol 3 projected for a 1995 launch will be an environment monitoring micro satellite this satellite may be the precursor to a series of small earth observation satellites the keos korean earth observation system project which has been submitted for approval to the south korean government would use two or three 300 kg spacecraft equipped with optical and microwave sensors south korean press reports claim there is also a parallel military effort to establish the capabilities for building and launching small military satellites by 2001 supposedly a government panel had been established to oversee such an effort funded at us 500 m between 1993 and 2001 in anticipation of an expected pullout of u s intelligence gathering systems from the korean peninsula in conjunction with all of these reported efforts south korean is also pursuing production work either as off sets to existing aerospace technology contracts for example mcdonnell douglas is offsetting production of some delta parts to south korean firms as part of the koreasat launch contracts or for production of consumer space items among other products south korea exports satellite receiver television setups to japan and samsung has announced teaming for production of osc s orbcomm user terminals this looks like a very aggressive push into space technologies considering that east asia is currently the fastest growing sector for commercial space services primarily for telecommunications a south korean push into space technologies may change the composition of commercial space market there over the next decade 13 space technology indexes through march as announced in the last csn sti each issue will give the results of stock indexes and portfolios regarding space stocks and investments the table below summarizes results to the end of march the space technology index did quite a bit better than the market as a whole as represented by the s p 500 index since 90 of the values included in the index are us firms this represents a general increase in the market value of space related firms the increase in the first quarter is more than in all of 1992 which is a very promising sign although future months may reverse this trend the commercial space technology index has also done quite well but the pure play portfolio consisting of stocks of firms which are pure plays in space technologies has also surpassed its results in all of 1993 we ll keep an eye on these index results through march beginning beginning 1 jan 93 to 1992 1993 31 mar 1993 s p 500 416 436 4 7 452 3 7 space tech index 267 304 13 6 373 22 7 comm l space tech index 167 194 16 3 222 14 2 space tech pure plays 147 169 15 4 197 16 2 final notes what this column s already full and i still have bunches of commercial space developments to report on as i said at the start of this column there s been a lot of interesting happenings but i ll have to put them into the next issue looking ahead i ve got several articles in the works on new happenings with iridium and the leo communications satellite market more news on international launchers appearing and disappearing on the market new international commercial space ventures and other interesting developments and as always i hope you folks find this stuff useful and interesting any and all comments are welcome
1 | name your price cap colours quantity available cheers mike
2 | i just wanted to point out that some of the food particularly the soups are prepared in a big batch so the restaurant won t be able to take the msg out of it sometimes its pretty hard to find out if this is the case or not
3 | hi i was reading through the spaceflight handbook and somewhere in there the author discusses solar sails and the forces acting on them when and if they try to gain an initial acceleration by passing close to the sun in a hyperbolic orbit the magnitude of such accelerations he estimated to be on the order of 700g he also says that this is may not be a big problem for manned craft because humans and this was published in 1986 have already withstood accelerations of 45g all this is very long winded but here s my question finally are 45g accelerations in fact humanly tolerable with the aid of any mechanical devices of course if these are possible what is used to absorb the acceleration can this be extended to larger accelerations

2 | in fairness we should note that if you look up speculum in the dictionary which i did when this question first surfaced the first definition is a mirror or polished metal plate used as a reflector in optical instruments which doesn t mean the name fits in this context but it s not as far off as you might think
2 | reply to dufault lftfld enet dec com md infantile spasms have been well understood for quite some time now you are seeing a pediatric neurologist aren t you if not i strongly recommend it there is a new anticonvulsant about to be released called felbamate which may be particularly helpful for infantile spasms as for learning more about seizures ask your doctor or his nurse about a local support group
1 | yes you increase the rpm slip of a boxer type fan by installing a capacitor in series with the fan s power supply the air flow of small 3 5 inch fans can be reduced by about 50 by using a 1 to 4 uf capacitor use a good grade nonpolarized unit with working voltage rating around 250 volts note that some impriical study is usually required to experimentally determine the best size capacitor for a given application for dc powered applications try the radio shack 12 volt box fan it can run and start reliably from as low as about 4 5 vdc it is exceptionally quiet but at admittedly low flow i wish i knew who made the fans for radio shack

3 | i think if there is to be a prize and such there should be classes such as the following large corp small corp company based on reported earnings large government gnp and such small governemtn or political clout or gnp large organization planetary society and such small organization alot of small orgs the organization things would probably have to be non profit or liek of course this means the prize might go up larger get more or basically make the prize total purse 6 billion divided amngst the class winners more fair there would have to be a seperate organization set up to monitor the events umpire and such and watch for safety violations or maybe not if peopel want to risk thier own lives let them do it
2 | yes there is such a thing as eye dominance although i am not sure if this dominance refers to perscription strength as i recall if you selectively close your dominant eye you will percieve that the image shifts this will not happen if you close your other eye i believe that which eye is dominant is related to handedness but i can t recall the relation at the moment
2 | does the bates method work i first heard about it in this newsgroup several years ago and i have just got hold of a book how to improve your sight simple daily drills in relaxation by margaret d corbett authorized instructor of the bates method published in 1953 it talks about vision improvement by relaxation and exercise has there been any study on whether this method actually works if it works is it by actually shortening the previously elongated eyeball or by increasing the lens s ability to flatten itself in order to compensate for the too long eyeball since myopia is the result of eyeball elongation seems to me the most logical approach for correction is to find a way to reverse the process i e shorten it somehow preferably non surgically has there been any recent studies on this where can i find them i know rk works by changing the curvature of the cornea to compensate for the shape of eyeball but if there is a way to train the muscles to shorten the eyeball back to its correct length that would be even better bates s idea right
1 | can anyone please email a diagram or give me details of an ftp site where there is a diagram of a simple small fm mono voice transmitter for trasnmitting in the 90 104 range preferably above 100 mhz only a short distance requiered and frequency variation no too important but must run from 9v or smaller dc supply thanx in advance monty
1 | i want to convert a 500 volt sinewave with frequency between 1 khz and 10 khz to a 10 volt sinewave with the same frequency by means of a transformer the secondary current will be 6 a 600 ma what kind of transformer should i use ferrite can i buy one if so i need a partnumber and supplier if i cannot buy one how do i go about winding one myself what core do i use how big must it be in order not to saturate what thickness copper wire how many turns etc i know little about analog electronics so i hope some kind soul here will help me out pointers to relevant databooks will also be highly appreciated thanks

1 | i would appreciate some help in locating a telephone controlled power bar for my pc the unit would power up the pc when the telephone rings and keep it up as long as the telephone connection is present i also need to be able to power up this same pc through the use of an external timer i can supply power or a contact closure to do this i will summarize and post the results of this query here thank you
1 | hmm now where was that ad for the combination radio hand cranked generator flashlight siren i saw function generator has a 50mv offset and the amplitude s too high sure you ve already got the right idea ignoring the 50 ohm internal resistance of the generator for a second just run it into say a voltage divider made of 990 ohms in series with 10 ohms this new circuit is the thevenin equivalent of one that puts out 1 100 of the original voltage and has an output impedence of negligibly less than 10 ohms you may want to monkey with the values a little depending on whether you care more about the _exact_ dividing ratio or the availability of parts hows that sound joel kolstad
2 | thanks for all your assistance i ll see if he can try a different brand of patches although he s tried two brands already are there more than two the brands i can come up with off the top of my head are nicotrol nicoderm and habitrol there may be a fourth as well
3 | are breathable liquids possible i remember seeing an old nova or the nature of things where this idea was touched upon it might have been some other tv show if nothing else i know such liquids are possible because they showed a large glass full of this liquid and put a white mouse rat in it since the liquid was not dense the mouse would float so it was held down by tongs clutching its tail the thing struggled quite a bit but it was certainly held down long enough so that it was breathing the liquid it never did slow down in its frantic attempts to swim to the top now this may not have been the most humane of demonstrations but it certainly shows breathable liquids can be made
3 | if by that you mean anything on the gd approach there was an article on it in a recent avation week i don t remember the exact date but it was recent allen
3 | thanks again one final question the name gehrels wasn t known to me before this thread came up but the may issue of scientific american has an article about the inconstant cosmos with a photo of neil gehrels project scientist for nasa s compton gamma ray observatory same person mark brader softquad inc toronto information we want information utzoo sq msb msb sq com the prisoner
2 | some recent postings remind me that i had read about risks associated with the barbecuing of foods namely that carcinogens are generated is this a valid concern if so is it a function of the smoke or the elevated temperatures is it a function of the cooking elements wood or charcoal vs lava rocks i wish to know more thanks
3 | exactly some of the space 1999 effects remain first rate even today later on the andersons tried to shed their reputation as creators of some of the worst pseudo scientific shows in tv history by flying into infinity this was a one off thing done as part of bbc s educational sf series the day after tomorrow the anderson episode dealt with a spaceship capable of reaching the speed of light lightship altares the four man crew eventually journeyed into a black hole and ended up on the far side of the galaxy i think i saw this as a 9 year old back in 1976 and liked it very much but then again i was a fan of space 1999 so i guess i was easily satisfied in those days does anyone know if into infinity has been released on video i have some space 1999 shows on vhs and know that thunderbirds etc also are available in england
3 | but with cheaper fuel from space based sources it will be cheaper to reach more orbits than from the ground also remember that the presence of a repair supply facility adds value to the space around it if you can put your satellite in an orbit where it can be reached by a ready source of supply you can make it cheaper and gain benefit from economies of scale allen

1 | since your mosfet is a 1972 vintage it s probably not a very good one by today s standards if you have an idea about its voltage and current ratings e g 60vdc 6a you can probably get away with replacing it with anything with better specs early mosfets had a gate source voltage rating of approximately 20 vdcmax and they would usually turn completely on at 10vdc otherwise mosfets are not really mysterious they re more or less voltage controlled current sources if the mosfet in your circuit is used as an open loop voltage controlled current source you may have to experiment with various gain altering techniques
1 | uh oh umm there are a number of copy protection schemes some involve modifying the physical media and some involve encryption schemes c all of the ones that have existed over the course of computing have been successful for a time i recall however near monthly releases of new ways to crack the copy protection scheme of the latest releases the fact is none of them are completely secure or anywhere near it some are more or less difficult to crack and some have already been cracked i guess what i am saying is that your question is difficult if not impossible to answer what exactly do you want to know do you need a good one for a project you are working on how secure must it be are you trying to crack one that someone else has used i can probably make suggestions assuming the activity is strictly legal in general it is a bad idea legally to tamper with copy protection it can also lead to corruption of files which you necessarily do not have back ups of being as they are copy protected which can be devestating do you have absolutely no ideas for practical applications and are merely curious please clear up those questions and i ll try to help as much as i can incidentally the uh oh at the top is indicative of the dread anyone who has watched their friends hacking equipment be carted off feels when they are asked how to hack the area you are broaching is wrought with dangers many of which include breaking the law or at least addressing it from one side or the other

1 | thus a decibell deci l tenth of bell is a fractional part of the original bell for example southwestern bell is a decibell out of what hat did you pull this one db is a ratio not an rboc and the measure of current amp is actually named after both the amp company and the amphenol company both companies revolutionized electronics by simulatenously realizing that the performance of connectors and sockets were affected by the amount of current running through the wires sorry the unit for current is the ampere which is the name of a french man named ampere who studied electrical current the term amp is just an abbreviation of it the company amp came after the ampere unit was already in use the ohmite company was the first to characterize resistances by numbers thus our use of the ohms i don t know about this one but it doesn t sound right alexander graham bell actually is where bell came from well you got one thing right actually i think j chiu knows the score and is just being silly however decibel is in fact 1 10th of a bel he is right on that one but i don t know if it was accidental or not strictly defined a bel is the ratio of the log of two power levels and a decibel is 1 10th of a bel so you have 10x decibels for every bel hence bel log p2 p1 and decibel 10xlog p2 p1 the bel ohm volt farad ampere watt hertz henry etc are all named for pioneers in the field it s a traditional and fine way to honor researchers who discover new knowledge in a new field hertz was one of the most important of the early electronics explorers but had been left out in having a term or unit named after him until recently 1960 s prior to that what is now a hertz was a cps all the other units were defined many decades earlier

3 | lindbergh s flight took place in 27 not the thirties could you give examples of privately funded ones your logic certainly applies to standard investment strategies however the concept of a prize for a difficult goal is done for different reasons i suspect i m not aware that mr orteig received any significant economic benefit from lindbergh s flight modern analogies such as the prize for a human powered helicopter face similar arguments there is little economic benefit in such a thing the advantage comes in the new approaches developed and the fact that a prize will frequently generate far more work than the equivalent amount of direct investment would a person who puts up x billion for a moon base is much more likely to do it because they want to see it done than because they expect to make money off the deal
3 | well pardon me for trying to continue the discussion rather than just tugging my forelock in dismay at having not considered actually trying to recover the energy from this process which is at least trying to go the right way on the energy curve now where did i put those sackcloth and ashes i was not and am not pretending anything i am so pleased you are not surprised though note that i didn t say it was perpetual motion or even that it sounded like perpetual motion the phrase was sounds almost like perpetual motion which i at least consider a somewhat different propposition than the one you elect to criticize perhaps i should beg your pardon for being too precise in my use of language i will believe that this process comes even close to approaching technological and economic feasibility given the mixed nature of the trash that will have to be run through it as opposed to the costs of separating things first and having a different run for each actinide when i see them dump a few tons in one end and pull relatively clean material out the other once the costs technological risks etc are taken into account i still class this one with the idea of throwing waste into the sun sure it s possible and the physics are well understood but is it really a reasonable approach and i still wonder at what sort of burning rate you could get with something like this as opposed to what kind of energy you would really recover as opposed to what it would cost to build and power with and without the energy recovery are we talking ounces pounds or tons grams kilograms or metric tons for you si fans of material and are we talking days weeks months or years days weeks months or years for you si fans hmmm still using a non decimated time scale i see insisting on perfect safety is for people who don t have the balls to live in the real world mary shafer nasa ames dryden
2 | nutrasweet is a synthetic sweetener a couple thousand times sweeter than sugar some people are concerned about the chemicals that the body produces when it degrades nutrasweet it is thought to form formaldehyde and known to for methanol in the degredation pathway that the body uses to eliminate substances the real issue is whether the levels of methanol and formaldehyde produced are high enough to cause significant damage as both are toxic to living cells all i can say is that i will not consume it phenylalanine is nothing for you to worry about it is an amino acid and everyone uses small quantities of it for protein synthesis in the body some people have a disease known as phenylketoneurea and they are missing the enzyme necessary to degrade this compound and eliminate it from the body for them it will accumulate in the body and in high levels this is toxic to growing nerve cells therefore it is only a major problem in young children until around age 10 or so or women who are pregnant and have this disorder it used to be a leading cause of brain damage in infants but now it can be easily detected at birth and then one must simply avoid comsumption of phenylalanine as a child or when pregnant

3 | what evidence indicates that gamma ray bursters are very far away their distribution is very isotropic and the intensity distribution crudely speaking indicates we re seeing an edge to the distribution given the enormous power i was just wondering what if they are quantum black holes or something like that fairly close by why would they have to be at galactic ranges now in the good old days before gro data it was thought the gamma bursters were neutron stars in the galaxy it was expected that gro would confirm this by either showing they were a local population within a few hundred light years or that they were in the galactic halo mechanism was not known but several plausible ones existed also to be fair it was noted that the _brightest_ burster was probably in the lmc suggesting theorists might be wrong back then as the sun is not at the center of the galaxy a halo population should show anisotropy a local disk population is ruled out completely at this stage to avoid the anisotropy you have to push the halo out the energy then gets large the mechanism of getting ns out that far becomes questionable and we should start to see for example the andromeda s bursters the data is consistent with either a oort cloud distribution but only just but no one can think of a plausible source with the right spectrum or it can be a cosmological distances hence isotropy and the edge is the edge of the universe if at cosmological distances you need very high energy to detect and a very compact source for spectrum ergo a neutron star colliding with another neutron star or black hole even then getting the spectrum is very hard but conceivable if we know anything about physics at that level the bursters are not due to quantum black holes or cosmic strings wrong spectrum for one thing the situation is further complicated by recent claims that there are two classes of sources in the colliding ns they d actually probably fit relatively easily into the ns ns and ns bh collision scenarios respectively my own pet theory is that it s flying saucers entering hyperspace but the reason i am asking is that most everyone assumes that they are colliding nuetron stars or spinning black holes i just wondered if any mechanism could exist and place them closer in if you can think of one remember to invite me to stockholm

2 | ks from keith actrix gen nz keith stewart ks my wife has become interested through an acquaintance in post polio syndrome ks this apparently is not recognised in new zealand and different symptons eg ks chest complaints are treated separately does anone have any information i m not sure that this condition is recognised anywhere in the sense of a disease with diagnostic criteria clear boundaries between it and other diseases unique pathologic or physiologic features etc but here goes with what many neurologists agree on post polio syndrome patients have evidence of motor neuron disease by clinical examination emg and muscle biopsy the abnormalities are mostly chronic due to old polio but there is evidence of ongoing deterioration clinically the patients complain of declining strength and endurance with everyday motor tasks musculoskeletal pain is a nearly universal feature that doubtless contributes to the impaired performance the examination shows muscle weakness and atrophy the emg shows evidence of old denervation with reinnervation giant and long duration motor unit action potentials and evidence of active denervation fibrillation potentials the biopsy also shows old denervation with reinnervation fiber type grouping and evidence of active denervation small angulated fibers with dense oxidative enzyme staining but curiously little or no group atrophy post polio patients do not have als in als there is clinically evident deterioration from one month to the next in post polio the patients are remarkably stable in objective findings from one year to the next of course there are patients who had polio before who develop genuine als but als is no more common among polio survivors than among people who never had polio the cause of post polio syndrome is unknown there is little evidence that post polio patients have active polio virus or destructive immunologic response to virus antigen there is no solid evidence that patients with post polio have anything different happening to the motor unit anterior horn cells motor axons neuromuscular junctions and muscle fibers than patients with old polio who are not complaining of deterioration both groups can have the same emg and biopsy findings the reason for these acute changes in a chronic disease old polio is unknown possibly spinal motor neurons that have reinnervated huge numbers of muscle fibers start shedding the load after several years there are a couple of clinical features that distinguish post polio syndrome patients from patients with old polio who deny deterioration the pps patients are more likely to have had severe polio the pps patients are much more likely to complain of pain they also tend to score higher on depression scales of neuropsychologic tests my take on this i m sure some will disagree after recovery from severe polio there can be abnormal loading on muscles tendons ligaments bones and joints that leads to inflammatory and or degenerative conditions affecting these structures the increasing pain superimposed on the chronic but unchanging weakness leads to progressive impairment of motor performance and adl i am perhaps biased by personal experience of having never seen a pps patient who was not limited in some way by pain i do not believe that pps patients have more rapid deterioration of motor units than non pps patients i e those with old polio of similar severity but without pps complaints

2 | msg is common in many food we eat including chinese though some oriental restaurants might put a tad too much in them i ve noticed that when i go out and eat in most of the chinese food restaurants i will usually get a slight headache and an ununsual thirst afterwards this happens to many of my friends and relatives too and heh we eat chinese food all the time at home but we don t use msg when we re cooking for ourselves so when we put one and one together it can be safely assumed that msg may cause some allergic reactions in some people stick with natural things msg doesn t do body any good and possibly harms for that matter so why bother with it taste food as it should be tasted and don t cloud the flavor with an imaginary cloak of msg michael

2 | okay mr dyer we re properly impressed with your philosophical skills and ability to insult people you re a wonderful speaker and an adept politician however i believe that all you were asked to do was simply provide scientific research refuting the work of olney i don t think the original poster sought to start a philisophical debate she wanted some information given a little effort one could justify that shooting oneself with a 45 before breakfast is a healthy practice but we re not particularily interested in what you can verbally prove disprove or rationalize where s the research where are the studies i appoligize if this sounds flamish i simply would like to see the thread get back on track lone wolf

2 | has no mitigate literature first let me offer you my condolences i ve had kidney stones 4 times and i know the pain she is going through first it is best that she see a doctor however every time i had kidney stones i saw my doctor and the only thing they did was to prescribe some pain killers and medication for a urinary tract infection the pain killers did nothing for me kidney stones are extremely painful my stones were judged passable so we just waited it out however the last one took 10 days to pass not fun anyway if she absolutely won t see a doctor i suggest drinking lots of fluids and perhaps an over the counter sleeping pill but i do highly suggest seeing a doctor kidney stones are not something to fool around with she should be x rayed to make sure there is not a serious problem
3 | my understanding is that the expected errors are basically known bugs in the warning system software things are checked that don t have the right values in yet because they aren t set till after launch and suchlike rather than fix the code and possibly introduce new bugs they just tell the crew ok if you see a warning no 213 before liftoff ignore it good grief and i thought the shuttle software was known for being well engineered if this is actually the case every member of the programming team should be taken out and shot given that i ve heard the shuttle software rated as level 5 in maturity i strongly doubt that this is the case

3 | the following are my thoughts on a meeting that i hugh kelso and bob lilly had with an aide of sen patty murrays we were there to discuss ssto and commercial space this is how it went after receiving a packet containing a presentation on the benifits of ssto i called and tried to schedule a meeting with our local senator d patty murray washington state i started asking for an hour and when i heard the gasp on the end of the phone i quickly backed off to 1 2 an hour later in that conversation i learned that a standard appointment is 15 minutes we got the standard bozo treatment that is we were called back by an aide who scheduled a meeting with us in order to determine that we were not bozos and to familiarize himself with the material and to screen it to make sure that it was appropriate to take the senators time with that material well i got allocated 1 2 hour with sen murrays aide and we ended up talking to him for 45 minutes with us ending the meeting and him still listening we covered a lot of ground and only a little tiny bit was dcx specific most of it was a single stage reusable vehicle primer there was another woman there who took copius quantities of notes on every topic that we brought up but with murray being new we wanted to entrench ourselves as non corporate aligned i e not speaking for boeing local citizens interentested in space so we spent a lot of time covering the benifits of lower cost access to leo solar power satellites are a big focus here so we hit them as becoming feasible with lower cost access and we hit the environmental stand on that we hit the tourism angle and i left a copy of the patric collins tourism paper with side notes being that everyone who goes into space and sees the atmosphere becomes more of an environmentalist esp after seeing the smog over l a we hit on the benifits of studying bone decalcification which is more pronounced in space and said that that had potential to lead to understanding of and maybe a cure for osteoporosis we hit the education whereby kids get enthused by space but as they get older and find out that they havent a hop in hell of actually getting there they go on to other fields with low cost to orbit the chances they might get there someday would provide greater incentive to hit the harder classes needed we hit a little of the get nasa out of the operational launch vehicle business angle we hit the lower cost of satellite launches gps navigation personal communicators tellecommunications new services etc jobs provided in those sectors jobs provided building the thing balance of trade improvement etc we mentioned that skypix would benifit from lower launch costs we left the paper on what technologies needed to be invested in in order to make this even easier to do and he asked questions on this point we ended by telling her that we wanted her to be aware that efforts are proceeding in this area and that we want to make sure that the results from these efforts are not lost much like condor or majellan and most importantly we asked that she help fund further efforts along the lines of lowering the cost to leo in the middle we also gave a little speal about the lunar resource data purchase act and the guy filed it separately he was very interested in it he asked some questions about it and seemed like he wanted to jump on it and contact some of the people involved with it so something may actually happen immediatly there the last two things we did were to make sure that they knew that we knew a lot of people in the space arena here in town and that they could feel free to call us any time with questions and if we didn t know the answers that we would see to it that they questions got to people who really did know the answers then finally we asked for an appointment with the senator herself he said that we would get on the list and he also said that knowing her this would be something that she would be very interested in although they do have a time problem getting her scheduled since she is only in the state 1 week out of 6 these days all in all we felt like we did a pretty good job

2 | i was part of a study a few years ago at the university of arizona to see whether cross dominant individuals those with a particular handedness but who had dominance in the opposite eye were better hitters than those with same side dominance of hand and eye i was picked from my softball class because i was cross dominant right hand left eye which put me in a small minority and the grad student was trying to get an equal number of cross dominant and same side dominant people to control the study she used a pitching machine fast pitch since i was used to slow pitch i didn t come close actually i think i foul tipped a few to hitting the ball if there were a lot of people like me in her study i e those who can t hit fast pitch or are not used to hitting off a machine i would seriously question the results of that study i think there have been some studies of major league players across a fairly large cross section of players to test whether eye dominance being the same or opposite side was better but i don t know the results the woman who ran the study i was in said that there was a higher incidence of crossdominance in major leaguers than across the general population but i m not sure whether i d believe her
3 | i was at an interesting seminar at work uk s r a l space science dept on this subject specifically on a small scale solar sail proposed as a student space project the guy giving the talk was keen to generate interest in the project i ll typein the handout he gave out at the meeting here goes the microlight solar sail 1 introduction the solar sail is a well established concept harnessing the pressure of sunlight a spacecraft would have unlimited range in principle such a vehicle could explore the whole solar system with zero fuel consumption however it is more difficult to design a practical solar sail than most people realize the pressure of sunlight is only about one kilogram per square kilometer deploying and controlling the large area of aluminized fabric which would be necessary to transport a conventional type spacecraft is a daunting task this is why despite the potential of hte idea no such craft has actually been launched to date 2 design recent advances in microelectronics make possible a different concept a tiny sail just a few metres in diameter which could be controlled purely be electronics with no mechanical parts several attitude control methods are feasible for example the pressure sunlight exerts on a panel of solar cells varies according to whether power is being drawn the key components of the craft will be a minute ccd camera developed at edinburgh university which can act as both attitude sensor and data gathering device solar cells providing 1 watt power for control and communication and a directional radio antenna etched onto the surface of the sail itself launched as a piggyback payload the total cost of the mission can be limited to a few tens of thousands of dollars 3 missions the craft would be capable of some ambitious missions for example a it could rendezvous with a nearby asteroid from the apollo or amor groups closeup pictures could be transmitted back to earth at a low bit rate b it could be steered into a lunar polar orbit previously unobserved areas around the lunar poles could be viewed by angling the sail to reflect sunlight downwards polar craters whose bases never receive sunlight could be imaged bright reflections would confirm that volatiles such as water ice have become trapped in these locations immensely valuable information for setting up a manned lunar base btw c it could be sent to rendezvous with a small asteroid or comet nucleus impacting at low speed a thin wire probe attached to the craft causes it to rebound while capturing a tiny sample is a sharp edged tube like performing a biopsy returning to earth the sail acts as an ideal re entry parachute load per unit area 20 gm m2 ensures that heat is reradiated so efectively that the sail temperature cannot exceed 300 deg c the material sample is recovered enclosed in a small insulating container contact colin jack tel 0865 200447 oxford mathematical designs 131 high street oxford ox1 4dh england this guy would love to hear from anyone interested in this project or seeking details or anything and would be most happy to send you more information andy

2 | the answer to your first question is rather difficult to answer without doing a lot of autopsies the second question is something that s been known for some time it appears that within about 15 years of quitting smoking a person s risk for developing lung cancer drops to that of the person who never smoked assuming you do not get lung cancer in the interim the risk to someone who smoked the equivalent of a pack per day for 40 years is around 20 times as high as a non smoker still rather low overall but significant personally i d be more concerned about heart disease secondary to smoking it s much more common and even a small increase in risk is significant there

2 | just had the opportunity to watch this flick on a e some 15 years since i saw it last i was very interested in the technology demonstrated in this film for handling infectious diseases and similar toxic substances clearly they faked a lot of the computer robotic technology certainly at the time it was made most of that was science fiction itself let alone the idea of a space germ quite coincidentally actually this is what got me wanted to see the movie again i watched a segment on the otherwise awful _how d they do that _ dealing with a disease researcher at the cdc s top lab there was description of the elaborate security measures taken so that building will never be cracked so to speak by man or nature short of deliberate bombing from the air perhaps and the researchers used spacesuits similar to that in the film i m curious what people think about this film short of silly is such a facility technically feasible today as far as the plot and the crystalline structure that is not life as we know it that s a whole nother argument for rec arts sf tech or something

1 | one not so quick question to throw out there for you guys for our class project we need to design and build a power supply to the following specs voltatge adjustable from 1 12v current limited at 1a voltage must stay within 2 of designated value for i from 0 1a ac ripple less than 5 mv rms of course we can t just use an adjustable voltage current limiting regulator chip our problem is with the current limiting i e we ve found stuff to do the rest of the parts of the circuit what the supply must do if presented with a load which would draw more than 1a given the supply voltage is reduce the voltage so that the current will equal one amp thus if we were to short the thing with the ammeter we should read one amp if we measure the current through a 1 ohm resistor at 12v we should read one amp and the output voltage by necessity must be 1v the only basic idea we have seen for the current limiter involves a circuit which will pull current off of the base of the output power transistor and therefore reduce the output so does anybody have any ideas we could work from thanks in advance andy collins kc6yey acollins uclink berkeley edu
2 | i love the faq the comment about contact lenses not being an option for any remaining correction after rk and possibly after prk is interresting why is this does anyone know for sure whether this applies to prk as well also why is it possible to get a correction in prk with involvement of only about 5 of the corneal depth while rk is done to a depth of up to 95 why such a difference i thought the proceedures were simmilar with the exception of a laser being the cutting tool in prk i must not be understanding all of the differences in the faq the vision was considered less clear after the surgery than with glasses alone if this is completly attributable to the intentional slight undercorrection then it can be compensated for when necessary with glasses or contacts if they can be worn afterall it is important to know if that is not the case however and some other consequence of the surgery would often interfere with clear vision the first thing that came to my mind was a fogging of the lense which glasses couldn t help would not help

1 | i m wondering if it s possible to use radio waves to measure the distance between a transmitter s and receiver seems to me that you should be able to measure the signal strength and determine distance this would be for short distances 2000 ft and i would need to have accuracy of 6 inches or so how about measuring vertical distance as well any chance or am i getting ridiculous what frequencies would be best for this or does matter sorry if i m mucking up the network with one of those questions best answered by bill willis via us mail and i apologize for not being tuned in to electronics

2 | as has been noted before there is the distinction between _motivation_ and _method_ no experimental result should be accepted unless it is described in sufficient detail to be replicated and the replications do indeed reproduce the result no theoretical argument should be accepted unless it is presented in sufficient detail to be followed and reasonable knowlegeable people agree with the force of the logic but people try experiments and pursue arguments for all sorts of crazy reasons irrational motivations are not just curiousities they are a large part of the history of science there are a couple of negative points to make here 1 a theory of qi could conceivably become accepted without direct verification of the existence of qi for example quarks are an accepted part of the standard model of physics with no direct verification what would be needed would be a theory based on qi that predicted medical reality better than the alternatives the central theoretical claim could lie forever beyond experiment as long as there was a sufficient body of experimental data that the qi theory predicted better than any other i wouldn t hold my breath waiting for the triumph of qi though i don t think that there is even a coherent theory based on it much less a theory that explains anything at all better than modern biology and it is hard to imagine a qi theory that would not predict some way of rather directly verifying the existence of qi 2 science has not historically progressed in any sort of rational experiment data theory sequence most experiments are carried out and interpreted in pre existing theoretical frameworks the theoretical controversies of the day determine which experiments get done overall there is a huge messy affair of personal jealousies crazy motivations petty hatreds and the like that determines which experiments and which computations get done what keeps it going forward is the critical function of science results don t count unless they can be replicated the whole system is a sort of mechanism for generate and test the generate part can be totally irrational as long as the test part works properly pasteur could believe whatever he liked about chemical activity and crystals but even mitscherlich had to agree that racemic acid crystals were handed that when you separate them by handedness you get two chemicals that rotate polarized light in opposite directions and the right rotating version was indistinguishable from tartaric acid pasteur s irrational motivation had led to a replicable and important result this is where lysenko creationists etc fail they have usually not even produced coherent theories that predict much of anything when their theories do predict and are contradicted by experiment they do not concede the point and modify their theories rather they try to suppress the results lysenko or try to divert attention to other evidence they think supports their position creationists
2 | i would say there are also significant numbers of unscrupulous doctors of the squeaky clean traditional crew cut talk to the ama before starting any treatment kind who recommend treatments that though accepted may not be necessary for the patient at the time and all for making a quick buck i would not be surprised if the cost of medical services in the u s is significantly inflated by these quacks of a different color in fact i d say these doctors are the most dangerous since they call into question the true focus of the medical profession the ama and the boards should focus on these quacks instead of devoting unbelievable energy on search and destroy missions to pull the licenses of those doctors who are trying non traditional or not fully accepted treatments for their desperate patients that traditional accepted medicine cannot help now to make a general comment on many recent posts lately i ve seen the word quack bandied about recklessly when a doctor or doctor wanna be has decided to quit discussing any controversial medical subject in a civilized manner all he she has to do is say quack quack and somehow they magically expect the readership of this newsgroup to roll over on their backs and pee pee on themselves in obedience what do they teach you in medical school how to throw your authority around let me put it another way to make my point clear quack is a nebulous word lacking in any precision its sole use is to obfuscate the issues at hand the indiscriminate use of this word is a sure sign of incompetency and coming from any medical doctor or wanna be where competency is expected is real scary but what do i know i ve already been diagnosed by the sci med gods in this newsgroup as being anal retentive and psychotic i look forward to more net diagnoses hey they re free jon quacks r us noring p s may i suggest seriously that if the doctors and wanna be doctors on the net who refuse to have an open mind on alternative treatments and theories such as the yeast theory should create your own moderated group you can call it sci med traditional moderated or sci med ama approved so you can keep anal retentives like me out of it charter member infj club
2 | no there s no evidence that would convince any but the most credulous the evidence is identical to the sort of evidence that has been used to justify all sorts of quack treatments for quack diseases in the past i like the implication here it must not be that the quacks making millions off such diseases are biased rather that those who doubt their existence don t understand the real world it seems easy to picture a 19th centure snake oil salesman saying the same thing however i have been in the trenches long enough to have seen multiple quack diseases rise and fall in popularity systemic yeast syndome seems to be making a resurgence it had fallen off a few years ago there will be new such diseases i m sure with best selling books and expensive therapies well this of course is convincing i guess i d better start diagnosing any illnesses that people want so that i can keep my lips

1 | first of all realize that tesla invented ac power generators motors transformers conductors etc technically all transformers are tesla coils in general though when someone refers to a tesla coil they mean an air core resonant transformer the tv flyback version tesla coil see the _encyclopedia_of_electronic_circuits_ v3 106 1 for diagram has not an air core it is of a class of circuit called oscillating shuttle circuit osc generally osc s are highly efficient but this version uses transistors and resistors which are very lossy devices typically tesla used active reactances instead of passive resistors so that he could achieve efficiencies of 99 5 and better the usual application of an air core resonant transformer or of an osc is to produce strong emi for wireless broadcasts how well do you think your computer screen would work if we removed the hf hv tesla flyback coil from it if we were to remove from our homes and industries all tesla coils our lights would go dark our cars would sputter and die our radios would go silent our industries would grind to a halt and we would have to go back to using coal for heat gas for lamps horses for transportation steam for power and telegraph for communication is that real world enough for you get the message we would not have 1 100 the convieniences we have today if not for tesla give credit where credit is due if it had been up to edison we d still be in the 19th century flame me at your own peril i m very good at putting edison down et tesla was 100 years ahead of his time perhaps now his time comes
3 | does anyone know how to size cold gas roll control thruster tanks for sounding rockets well first you work out how much cold gas you need then make the tanks big enough our sounding rocket payload with telemetry guidance etc etc and a telescope cluster weighs around 1100 pounds it uses freon jets for steering and a pulse width modulated controller for alignment ie during our eight minutes in space the jets are pretty much continuously firing on a 10 duty cycle or so the jets also need to kill residual angular momentum from the spin stabilization and flip the payload around to look at the sun we have two freon tanks each holding 5 liters of freon i m speaking only from memory of the last flight the ground crew at wsmr choose how much freon to use based on some black magic algorithm they have extra tank modules that just bolt into the payload stack this should give you an idea of the order of magnitude for cold gas quantity if you really need to know send me email and i ll try to get you in touch with our ground crew people cheers craig
2 | we were talking about migraine and exercise i m the one who can t fathom the thought of exercise during migraine anyway turning the thread around the other day i played tennis during my lunch hour i m out of tennis shape so it was very intense exercise i got overheated and dehydrated afterwards i noticed a tingling sensation all over my head then about 2 hours later i could feel a migraine start i continued to drink water in the afternoon i took cafergot but it didn t help and the pain started although it wasn t as intense as it usually is and about 9pm that night the pain subsided this isn t the first time that i ve had a migraine occur after exercise i m wondering if anyone else has had the same experience and i wonder what triggers the migraine in this situation heat buildup dehydration i m not giving up tennis so is there anything i can do besides get into shape and don t play at high noon to prevent this thanks

3 | ether implodes 2 earth core is gravity this paper both describes how heavenly bodys can be stationary ether sucking structures and why we observe orbital motion ether the theoretical propogation media of electro magnetic waves was concluded not to exist based on the results of the michelson moreley experiment conducted a century ago i propose that those conclusions are flawed based on the fact that the experiment was designed to look for a flow parallel to the earth s surface not perpindicular due to the prevailing assumption that the earth traveled through the ether as a ball through the wind the reversal of the that conclusion a pivotal keystone in the development of modern scientific thought could have ramifications of biblical proportions through out the world remember einstien said imagination is greater than knowledge 1 i dream like this ether based reality the ether is like a fluid out of phase with our reality creations start as a lattice placed into the ether given a spin the lattices both drag the fluid like a margarita blender and ingest it converting it distilling localized mass time and energy non spinning lattice dark matter the earth isn t exactly spinning around the sun picture an image of a galaxy we haven t any videos of them spinning picture us being stationary and the sun s image being dragged across the sky by the spinning ether field picture an onion each layer of which is spinning a little faster than the next a thread shot at the inner kernel would be stretched diagonally sideways its head being in a faster shell than its tail until it finally intersected the ground of the inner kernel its direction vector being straight down but its foot print being a line not a point sunrise sunset the moon isn t exactly orbiting us it is a parasite non self spin sustaining being dragged in the earth s ether field which is itself in the sun s much more powerful field our seasons are the wobble of earth s axis like a top slowing down the orbit of the earth around the sun is all of the stars images being dragged around by the sun s ether feild the earth moon and sun are about the same size and distance apart its just that the time between them varies greatly because the path is not the same the moon s lattice in the ether is like sticking a fork in a plate of spaghetti and giving the plate a half turn the sun s lattice has so much spin that its like the fork has got the whole plate of noodles wound up the piece of light going to the moon can slide down the spaghetti and maybe make a j hook at the end the piece of light going to the sun has to go around the whole plate like a needle in a record before it gets there with a pencil compass and rule draw a diagram of how the moon can be about as big as earth s shadow upon it and at other times totally eclipse the sun look in the sky except for your knowledge would you guess that they are about the same size just because they look about the same size o e o o o s e m or m _ _ s the full moon quarter moon etc is the difference between rate of ether spins what we are looking at is a rotating turntable view of the moon only half of which is facing the sun i ve seen a half moon within about 120 degrees of sky of the sun during the day try and draw that earth shadow its only the moon s image which appears to orbit us no matter where it is the light part is the part facing the sun and the dark part is the half facing away from the sun even when it appears to be behind us light years between galaxies is a misnomer the distance is closer to zero as time and matter are characteristics of this phase of reality which dissipates outward with each layer of the onion defining edge 0 ether spin what we are seeing could be essentially happening now the piece of light may have experienced many years but the trip could be very quick our time to time travel or warp space i might consider learning to de spin myself phase out my mass good luck trying to design a propulsion system to drag around a space time locality its like trying to move a balloon by shooting a squirt gun from within to find out about all of this i recommend studying history i d look in the book of life or holy grail etc brain waves just might carry decipherable data i d start looking on some part of the spectra said to be unusable due to all the background noise 4 billion humans i d totally isolate myself record me thinking dog backwards and learn to read what i got microsoft holy grail card for pentium next concluding that my thoughts were recorded on a non time bound media the ether and that it is i who move forward in time i would try to temporarily locally reverse the flow of time which i d start looking for as flowing opposite magnetism pole to pole why not perhaps by passing a large flat dc current through a two foot diameter coil or choke or something and seeing what i could get with my machine s receiver next to it if you don t think you ll live to see it consider this quit putting the reproductive keys of other life in your body all of life s data could be written on the wind ether not just our thoughts dna could be a little receiver or file access code by eating seeds we could be jamming our reception or receiving plant instructions try eating seed bearing fruit maybe those greek or biblical guys did live hundreds of years i m curios to see what they did and ate don t worry if your hair stops growing maybe we don t need to eat at all the cosmos are formed from nothing and that is creating matter i only need enough to bounce around where did the household concept immortal come from wheat is a weed it is programmed to pull from the soil reproduce like hell and then die warning about writing to the past i had a little dream of being in a world in the near parallel future lying along a path of history which we have diverged from there were twelve telepathic glowing beings who looked like an oscar award and who had always been a dark one who looked like us and then myself the dark one was in the process of making the others into gods he had to teach them what that meant by advising them in their past basically he manipulated them into reproducing and raising their children on his seed he said that the little ones who looked different were a sub species meant to provide service he carefully combed through history rewriting it in his favor pulling like a weed anything that compromised his control he enticed recruits by sending them his visions saying that there was immortality at the end of the road for only twelve souls kill or be killed the amount of control he could exert was finite though as at every change he made a void would appear in our reality the universe one day ended 100 meters from us it seemed odd but we couldn t remember how else it should be then some of the twelve were no more finally when he could prune no more and reality stopped just beyond his fingertips he stepped through his portal to the past to bask over and over in all that he had created i made a few more changes and lost my body existing only on the wind moral its very possible to eliminate from your reality the souls whose will s are not in harmony with yours golden rule treat others as you wish to be treated i e you could end up along a lonely thread of time with murderers or flowery brown nosers for playmates its not eternal there s more than one way back accepting rides to the past once here the one who looks like us sells rides he can make you a prince or a queen or you can live as a god in ancient greece go ahead repeat the third grade as often as you like adam henry i hope you like inspecting your socks careful though if he likes your work but thinks you re getting wise he can direct you to cross paths with your old self and you ll vanish as you rewrite your own course of history none the wiser as we pass the point along the parallel line where he stepped back in time his hierarchy will lose its direction he can still make changes while he s here its just that that is work and with every adjustment this becomes less the world he cultivated which loosens his grip and his organization is suddenly one branch less but he can t see the change the basic nature of man is good he had to apply his hand to achieve his world as he now tightens his hand to retain what he built the more sand slips through his fingers how about public computer access to the i r s its our country our money and they re spending it on us right imagine this washington marks the next cost at 8 irs collects 10 gives 5 to congress and just absolutely buries 5 congress borrows 2 the banks are making what a 30 margin interest on our government big corporations are ecstatic if they can do a 10 margin what do

back a tenth of what they produce have we been deceived if we are more efficient why is it getting harder to get by what if the point is just to keep the people busy making widgets in that other reality i shouted to the twelve its chaos they said no its order he defined chaos as that which is he was not able to control rain forest the problem could be that all the water in its canopy would hide the location of an indigenous people who have no language telepathic and vanishing the closest knowledge of death think of the spine as a transceiver if it is on the ground and pointed up you can locate it from above these people are probably naive as children but very very tough to kill also they should be able to tell you stories about the dark one that i talk about they can hear him i think

women with children babes in arms historical references to women and children as a single unit could mean that infants were not cut from the umbilical cord and hence were not breast fed i think that there may be some very interesting results to this such as mother child telepathy and blue blooded infants there are examples of this practice in the aquatic mammal kingdom to investigate that guy is the master of illusion and the ultimate liar he tells it first and then just follows the thread of time in which the people are willing to buy it in which he can make it so he ll play a poker face up until he thinks he s cornered and then he ll whine beg and grovel all it means to him is that you re willing to live on the ground work that he has laid that is that he was right and he didn t over play his hand and he won t need to go back and try another thread of time you have ultimate control over your destiny just don t live along a path that leads to a reality in which you don t want to be

1 | could someone please tell me if a 1 4 decoder is the same as a 1 to 4 demultiplexer i know how to link 2 of these to get an 8 output circuit but how do i link 5 of these to make a 1 16 multiplexer sorry if this seems like a lame question but i m only a newbie to electronics and i have to do this circuit please make any mail as droolproof as possible
2 | two thoughts i think that psychologically it will be easier for the next generation to accept genetic manipulation it seems that people frown upon messing with nature ignoring our eons old practice of doing just that any new human intervention is arrogance and hubris and manipulation we routinely do is natural and certainly not a big deal most interesting human traits will probably be massively polygenetic and be full of trade offs in addition without a positive social environment for the cultivation of genetic gifts having them won t be the advantage it s made out to be some people will certainly pursue it as if it is the grail but we know how most of those quests turn out

3 | i am sure mary or henry can describe this more aptly then me but here is how i understand it at speed near supersonic the wind behaves like a fluid pipe it becomes incompressible so wind has to bend away from the wing edges as the wing thickens the more the pipes bend if they have no place to go they begin to stall and force compression stealing power from the vehicle high drag if you squeeze the fuselage so that these pipes have aplace to bend into then drag is reduced essentially teh cross sectional area of the aircraft shoulf remain constant for all areas of the fuselage that is where the wings are subtract teh cross sectional area of the wings from the fuselage

1 | look at the 4053 this is a triple 2 to 1 transmission gate analog multiplexer with positive and negative power supplies can be run from a single ended supply as well with dual supplies the logic inputs still range from ground 0 volts to vdd this is a neat well i think so design for a switchable polarity amplifier input opamp output control x analog switch gnd all resistors are equal value when the analog switch is closed the amp is inverting gain of one with the switch open it is non inverting gain of one you can clean up the circuit to trim out input offset current if this hurts the balance this would show up as carrier feed through for high frequencies the slew rate of the opamp might cause problems especially if it isn t symmetrical and it usually isn t

2 | yes but typically they don t not every wild flight of fancy serves or can serve in the appropriate relation to a hypothesis it is somewhat interesting that when anyone is challanged to provide an example of this sort the only one they come up with is the one about kekule surely there must be others but apparently this is regarded as an extreme example of a non rational process in science whereby a successful hypothesis was proposed but how non rational is it of course we can t hope currently at least to explain how or why kekule had the daydream of snakes in the fire biting their tails surely it wasn t the only daydream he had what was special about this one could it have had something to do with a perceived analogy between the geometry of the snakes and problems concerning geometry of molecules is such analogical reasoning extra scientific or is it rather at the very heart of science perice s notion of abduction the use of models within and across disciplines upon close examination is there a non rational mystical leap taking place or is it perhaps closer to a formal though often incomplete analogy or model

what should i do what is this weird stuff old style wiring where do i buy stuff subject introduction disclaimers although we ve done a fair bit of wiring we are not electricians and we cannot be responsible for what you do if you re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe don t do it contact someone qualified a licensed electrician or your local electrical inspector electricity is no joke mistakes can result in shocks fires or electrocution furthermore our discussion is based on the u s national electrical code nec and the canadian electrical code cec to the best of our abilities we have confirmed every detail with the electrical code but we don t quote sections simply to keep this thing readable if you think we re wrong we invite you to correct us but please quote references the nec and the cec do not in and of themselves have the force of law many municipalities adopt it en toto others however do not check your with your local building department and provincial hydro inspection offices in canada to find out what applies in your area also your local electrical utility may also have special requirements for electrical service installation bear in mind too that we say here applies primarily to ordinary single family residences multi family dwellings mobile homes commercial establishments etc are sometimes governed by different rules also note that contrary to popular belief in the u s and in some parts of canada canada is not a wholly owned subsidiary of the u s consequently the nec does not apply in canada lots of things are the same including voltages line frequencies and the laws of physics but there are a number of crucial differences in the regulations where we can we ve noted them flagging the relevant passages with nec or cec remember that the cec and nec are minimal standards it is often smart to go beyond their minimal requirements subject what is the nec where can i get a copy the nec is a model electrical code devised and published by the national fire protection association an insurance industry group it s revised every three years the 1993 version has been released you can buy a copy at a decent bookstore or by calling them directly at 800 344 3555 the code exists in several versions there s the full text which is fairly incomprehensible there s an abridged edition which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses and there s the nec handbook which contains the authorized commentary on the code as well as the full text that s the recommended version unfortunately there s no handbook for the abridged edition and the full handbook is expensive us 65 plus shipping and handling subject what is the cec where can i get a copy the canadian standards association is an organization made up of various government agencies power utilities insurance companies electrical manufacturers and other organizations the csa publishes csa standard c22 1 which is updated every two or three years each province adopts with some amendments this standard and publishes a province specific code book since each province publishes its own slightly modified standard it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the csa standard itself in this faq cec really means the appropriate provincial standard in particular this faq is derived from the ontario hydro electrical safety code 20th edition 1990 which is in turn based on csa c22 1 1990 16th edition while differences exist between the provinces an attempt has been made to avoid specific to ontario detail the appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical inspection offices of your provincial power authority in ontario it s ontario hydro the ontario hydro book isn t overly fat it s about c 25 and includes mailed updates i hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the equivalent nec publications don t bother asking in quebec diy wiring is banned throughout the province subject can i do my own wiring extra pointers in most places homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring in some they re not check with your local electrical inspector most places won t permit you to do wiring on other s homes for money without a license nor are you permitted to do wiring in commercial buildings multiple dwellings eg duplexes are usually considered semi commercial or commercial however many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi commercial wiring if you re supervised by a licensed electrician if you can find one willing to supervise if you do your own wiring an important point do it neat and well what you really want to aim for is a better job than an electrician will do after all it s your own home and it s you or your family that might get killed if you make a mistake an electrician has time pressures has the skills and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast safe job in this faq we ve consciously given a few recommendations that are in excess of code because we feel that it s reasonable and will impress the inspector the inspector will know that you re an amateur you have to earn his trust the best way of doing this is to spend your time doing as neat a job as possible don t cut corners exceed specifications otherwise the inspector may get extremely picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions don t try to hide anything from the inspector use the proper tools ie don t use a bread knife to strip wires or twist wires with your fingers the inspector won t like it and the results won t be that safe and it takes longer and you re more likely to stick a hunk of 12ga wire through your hand that way don t handle house wire when it s very cold eg below 10c or 16f thermoplastic house wire particularly older types become very brittle subject what do i need in the way of tools first there s the obvious a hammer a drill a few screwdrivers both straight and phillips head if you re lucky enough to live in canada or find a source of csa approved devices you need robertson square recess screwdrivers 1 and 2 instead of phillips for drilling a few holes a 3 4 or 1 spade bit and 1 4 or 3 8 electric drill will do if you re doing a lot or are working with elderly lumber we recommend a 1 2 drill right angle drills are wonderful can be rented and 3 4 or 1 screw point auger drill bits these bits pull you through so they re much faster and less fatiguing even in 90 year old hardwood timbers screw driver bits are useful for drills expecially if you install your electrical boxes using screws drywall screws work well for stripping wire use a real wire stripper not a knife or ordinary wire cutters don t buy the 3 k mart combo stripper crimper and bottle opener types you should expect to pay 15 to 20 for a good plier type pair it will have sized stripping holes and won t nick or grab the wire it should be easy to strip wire with it one model has a small hole in the blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals there are fancier types autostrip cut but they generally aren t necessary and pros usually don t use them a pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends in constricted places don t use these for stripping wire you will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts you should have a pair of needle nose pliers for fiddling inside boxes and closing loops but it s better to form wire loops with a loop former hole on your wire stripper more accurate if you re using non metallic cable get a cable stripper for removing the sheath or do what some pros do they nick the end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a zipper and cut the sheath off you shouldn t try to strip the sheath with a knife point because it s too easy to slash the insulation on the conductors apparently stanley utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters hooked blades can be used to strip sheath but there is still the possibility that you ll gouge the conductors for any substantial amount of work with armored cable it s well worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter us 18 hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire or the insulation three prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly wired outlets about 6 multimeters tell you more but are a lot more expensive and probably not worth it for most people a simple voltage sensor which can detect potential through an insulated wire not supplying any devices is extremely helpful they cost about us 10 at radio shack you should have a voltage detector to check that the wires are dead before doing work on them neon bulb version are cheap 2 3 and work well if you get more serious a audible alarm type is good for tracing circuits without a helper though i ve been known to lock the drill on and hit breakers until the scream stops for running wires through existing walls you need fish tape often two tapes are needed though sometimes a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will suffice fish tapes can be rented electrical tape lots of it seriously a good and competent wiring job will need very little tape the tape is useful for wrapping dicy insulation in repair work another use is to wrap around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination screws i don t do this but drywall contractors prefer it to prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet that has no cover plate subject what is ul listing the ul stands for underwriters laboratory it used to be an insurance industry organization but now it is independent and non profit it tests electrical components and equipment for potential hazards when something is ul listed that means that the ul has tested the device and it meets their requirements for safety ie fire or shock hazard it doesn t necessarily mean that the device actually does what it s supposed to just that it probably won t kill you the ul does not have power of law in the u s you are permitted to buy and install non ul listed devices however insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to the failure of a non ul listed device furthermore in many situations the nec will require that a wiring component used for a specific purpose is ul listed for that purpose indirectly this means that certain parts of your wiring must be ul listed before an inspector will approve it and or occupancy permits issued subject what is csa approval every electrical device or component must be certified by the canadian standards association before it can be sold in canada implicit in this is that all wiring must be done with csa approved materials they perform testing similar to the ul a bit more stringent except that csa approval is required by law again like the ul if a fire was caused by non csa approved equipment your insurance company may not have to pay the claim in canada there is a branch organization of the ul called ulc ul of canada ulc does not have power of law and seems to be more a liason group between the csa and insurance companies subject are there any cheaper easier to read books on wiring usa the following three books were suggested by our readers residential wiring by jeff markell craftsman books carlsbad ca for 18 25 isbn 0 934041 19 9 practical electrical wiring residential farm and industrial based on the national electrical code ansi nfpa 70 herbert p richter and w creighton schwan mcgraw hill book co wiring simplified h p richter and w c schwan park publishing co try to make sure that the book is based on the latest nec revision which is currently 1990 canada p s knight authors and publishes a book called electrical code simplified there appears to be a version published specific to each province and is very tied into the appropriate provincial code it focuses on residential wiring and is indispensible for canadian diy ers it is better to get this book than the cec unless you do a lot of wiring or answer questions on the net it is updated each time the provincial codes are this book is available at all diy and hardware stores for less than c 10 subject inspections how and what why should i get my wiring inspected most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and inspections of any wiring that is done amongst other more mundane bureaucratic reasons like insurance companies not liking to have to pay claims a permit and inspections provides some assurance that you your family your neighbors or subsequent owners of your home don t get killed or lose their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your home or order you to tear out any wiring done without a permit california for instance is particularly nasty about this if fire starts in your home and un inspected wiring is at fault insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage claims in general the process goes like this you apply to your local inspections office or building department for a permit you should have a sketch or detailed drawing of what you plan on doing this is a good time to ask questions on any things you re not sure of if you re doing major work they may impose special conditions on you require loading calculations and ask other questions at this point they will tell you which inspections you will need if you re installing a main panel you will need to have the panel and service connections inspected before your power utility will provide a connection this is sometimes done by the local power authority rather than the usual inspectors after installing the boxes and wiring but before the insulation walls go up you will need a rough in inspection after the walls are up and the wiring is complete you will need a final inspection subject my house doesn t meet some of these rules and regulations do i have to upgrade in general there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings though there are some exceptions ie smoke detectors in some cases however any new work must be done according to the latest electrical code also if you do major work you may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all of your system check with your local electrical inspector subject a word on voltages 110 115 117 120 125 220 240 one thing where things might get a bit confusing is the different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of a circuit one person might talk about 110v another 117v or another 120v these are all in fact exactly the same thing in north america the utility companies are required to supply a split phase 240 volt 5 feed to your house this works out as two 120v 5 legs additionally since there are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring it s not unreasonable to find 120v has dropped to 110v or 240v has dropped to 220v by the time the power reaches a wall outlet especially at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run for a number of reasons some historical some simple personal orneryness different people choose call them by slightly different numbers this faq has chosen to be consistent with calling them 110v and 220v except when actually saying what the measured voltage will be confusing a bit just ignore it one thing that might make this a little more understandable is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower ie 110v instead of 120v value what this implies is that the device is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that low 208v is not the same as 240v 208v is the voltage between phases of a 3 phase y circuit that is 120v from neutral to any hot 480v is the voltage between phases of a 3 phase y circuit that s 277v from hot to neutral in keeping with 110v versus 120v strangeness motors intended to run on 480v three phase are often labelled as 440v subject what does an electrical service look like there are logically four wires involved with supplying the main panel with power three of them will come from the utility pole and a fourth bare wire comes from elsewhere the bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded into the ground or to a wire buried in the foundation or sometimes to the water supply pipe has to be metal continuous to where the main water pipe entering the house watch out for galvanic action conductivity breaks often between copper and iron pipe this is the grounding conductor it is there to make sure that the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground this wire normally carries no current one of the other wires will be white or black with white or yellow stripes or sometimes simply black it is the neutral wire it is connected to the centre tap cec center tap in the nec of the distribution transformer supplying the power it is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place often inside the panel the neutral and ground should not be connected anywhere else otherwise weird and or dangerous things may happen furthermore there should only be one grounding system in a home some codes require more than one grounding electrode these will be connected together or connected to the neutral at a common point still one grounding system adding additional grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house wiring is unsafe and contrary to code if you add a subpanel the ground and neutral are usually brought as separate conductors from the main panel and are not connected together in the subpanel ie still only one neutral ground connection however in some situations certain categories of separate buildings you actually do have to provide a second grounding electrode consult your inspector the other two wires will usually be black and are the hot wires they are attached to the distribution transformer as well the two black wires are 180 degrees out of phase with each other this means if you connect something to both hot wires the voltage will be 220 volts if you connect something to the white and either of the two blacks you will get 110v some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them this is either because the neutral and ground are connected together at a different point eg the meter or pole and one wire is doing dual duty as both neutral and ground or in some rare occasions the service has only one hot wire 110v only service subject what is a circuit inside the panel connections are made to the incoming wires these connections are then used to supply power to selected portions of the home there are three different combinations 1 one hot one neutral and ground 110v circuit 2 two hots no neutral and ground 220v circuit 3 two hots neutral and ground 220v circuit neutral and or two 110v circuits with a common neutral 1 is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and lighting within your house 3 is usually used for supplying power to major appliances such as stoves and dryers they often have need for both 220v and 110v or for bringing several circuits from the panel box to a distribution point 2 is usually for special 220v motor circuits electric heaters or air conditioners note in the us the nec frequently permits a circuit similar to 2 be used for stoves and dryers namely that there are two hot wires and a wire that does dual duty as neutral and ground and is connected to the frame as well as providing the neutral for 110v purposes three prong plugs instead of four only for stoves dryers connected to the main panel when connected to most sub panels 4 prong plugs and receptacles are required in our not so humble opinion this is crazy but the nfpa claims that this practice was re evaluated for the 1992 nec and found to be safe check your local codes or inquire as to local practice there are restrictions on when this is permissible 1 is usually wired with three conductor wire black for hot white for neutral and bare for grounding 2 and 3 have one hot wire coloured red the other black a bare wire for grounding and in 3 a white wire for neutral you will sometimes see 2 wired with just a black white and ground wire since the white is hot in this case both the nec and cec requires that the white wire be permanently marked at the ends to indicate that it is a live wire usually done with paint nail polish or sometimes electrical tape each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse there are in a few locales circuits that look like 1 2 or 3 except that they have two bare ground wires some places require this for hot tubs and the like one ground is frame ground the other attaches to the motor this may or may not be an alternative to gfci protection subject grounding versus grounded versus neutral according to the terminology in the cec and nec the grounding conductor is for the safety ground i e the green or bare wire the word neutral is reserved for the white when you have a circuit with more than one hot wire since the white wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the panel the proper term is grounded conductor however the potential confusion between grounded conductor and grounding conductor can lead to potentially lethal mistakes you should never use the bare wire as a grounded conductor or white wire as the grounding conductor even though they are connected together in the panel but not in subpanels subpanels are fed neutral and ground separately from the main panel usually in the trade and in common usage the word neutral is used for grounded conductor this faq uses neutral simply to avoid potential confusion we recommend that you use neutral too thus the white wire is always except in some light switch applications neutral not ground subject what does a fuse or breaker do what are the differences fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels for example if your toaster shorts out a fuse or breaker should trip protecting the wiring in the walls from melting as such fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the wiring ul or csa approval supposedly indicates that the equipment itself won t cause a fire fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt safely when the current exceeds the rated value thereby interrupting the power to the circuit fuses trip relatively fast which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have large startup current surges for motor circuits you can use a time delay fuse one brand is fusetron which will avoid tripping on momentary overloads a fusetron looks like a spring loaded fuse a fuse can only trip once then it must be replaced breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices they usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched into position against another contact when the current flow through the device exceeds the rated value a bimetallic strip heats up and bends by bending it trips the latch and the spring pulls the contacts apart circuit breakers behave similarly to fusetrons that is they tend to take longer to trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses with high overloads they trip quickly breakers can be reset a finite number of times each time they trip or are thrown when the circuit is in use some arcing takes place which damages the contacts thus breakers should not be used in place of switches unless they are specially listed for the purpose neither fuses nor breakers limit the current per se a dead short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time which can often cause severe damage subject breakers can t i use fuses statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher risk of causing a fire than breaker panels this is usually due to the fuse being loosely screwed in or the contacts corroding and heating up over time or the wrong size fuse being installed or the proverbial replace the fuse with a penny trick since breakers are more permanently installed and have better connection mechanisms the risk of fire is considerably less fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload when a fuse explodes the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting path result from complete meltdown of the electrical panel melted service wiring through fires in the electrical distribution transformer and having your house burn down breakers don t do this many jurisdictions particularly in canada no longer permit fuse panels in new installations the nec does permit new fuse panels in some rare circumstances requiring the special inserts to key the fuseholder to specific size fuses some devices notably certain large air conditioners require fuse protection in addition to the breaker at the panel the fuse is there to protect the motor windings from overload check the labeling on the unit this is usually only on large permanently installed motors the installation instructions will tell you if you need one subject what size wire should i use for a 20 amp circuit use 12 gauge wire for a 15 amp circuit you can use 14 gauge wire in most locales for a long run though you should use the next larger size wire to avoid voltage drops 12 gauge is only slightly more expensive than 14 gauge though it s stiffer and harder to work with here s a quick table for normal situations go up a size for more than 100 foot runs when the cable is in conduit or ganged with other wires in a place where they can t dissipate heat easily gauge amps 14 15 12 20 10 30 8 40 6 65 we don t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent on the application and precise wire type subject where do these numbers come from there are two considerations voltage drop and heat buildup the smaller the wire is the higher the resistance is when the resistance is higher the wire heats up more and there is more voltage drop in the wiring the former is why you need higher temperature insulation and or bigger wires for use in conduit the latter is why you should use larger wire for long runs neither effect is very significant over very short distances there are some very specific exceptions where use of smaller wire is allowed the obvious one is the line cord on most lamps don t try this unless you re certain that your use fits one of those exceptions you can never go wrong by using larger wire subject what does 14 2 mean this is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors in a cable the first number specifies the gauge the second the number of current carrying conductors in the wire but remember there s usually an extra ground wire 14 2 means 14 gauge two insulated current carrying wires plus bare ground 2 wire usually has a black white and bare ground wire sometimes the white is red instead for 220v circuits without neutral in the latter case the sheath is usually red too 3 wire usually has a black red white and bare ground wire usually carrying 220v with neutral subject what is a wirenut marrette marr connector how are they used a wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that s used to connect wires together marrette or marr connector are trade names you ll usually use a lot of them in diy wiring in essence you strip the end of the wires about an inch twist them together then twist the wirenut on though some wirenuts advertise that you don t need to twist the wire do it anyways it s more mechanically and electrically secure there are many different sizes of wire nut you should check that the wire nut you re using is the correct size for the quantity and sizes of wire you re connecting together don t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or your fingers use a pair of blunt nose linesman pliers and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly sometimes it s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it goes in the wirenut properly some people wrap the open end of the wirenut with electrical tape this is probably not a good idea the inspector may tear it off during an inspection it s usually done because a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut instead of taping it the connection should be redone subject what is a gfi gfci a gfci is a ground fault circuit interrupter it measures the current current flowing through the hot wire and the neutral wire if they differ by more than a few milliamps the presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other path this may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of an appliance or to the ground lead or through a person any of these situations is hazardous so the gfci trips breaking the circuit gfcis do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks if for example you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral leads of a circuit and no part of you was grounded a gfci wouldn t help all of the current that passed from the hot lead into you would return via the neutral lead keeping the gfci happy the two pairs of connections on a gfci outlet are not symmetric one is labeled load the other line the incoming power feed must be connected to the line side or the outlet will not be protected the load side can be used to protect all devices downstream from it thus a whole string of outlets can be covered by a single gfci outlet subject where should gfcis be used the nec mandates gfcis for 110v 15a or 20a single phase outlets in bathrooms kitchens within 6 of the sink garages unfinished basements or crawl spaces outdoors near a pool or just about anywhere else where you re likely to encounter water or dampness there are exceptions for inaccessible outlets those dedicated to appliances occupying fixed space typically refrigerators and freezers and for sump pumps and laundry appliances the cec does not mandate as many gfcis in particular there is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets or most garage or basement outlets basement outlets must be protected if you have a dirt floor garage outlets if they re near the door to outside bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have gfcis even if you are not required to have gfci protection you may want to consider installing it anyway unless you need a gfci breaker see below the cost is low in the u s gfci outlets can cost as little as us 8 costs are a bit higher in canada c 12 evaluate your own risk factors does your finished basement ever get wet do you have small children do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools does water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage subject where shouldn t i use a gfci gfcis are generally not used on circuits that a don t pose a safety risk and b are used to power equipment that must run unattended for long periods of time refrigerators freezers and sump pumps are good examples the rationale is that gfcis are sometimes prone to nuisance trips some people claim that the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary current imbalance tripping the gfci note though that most gfci trips are real if you re getting a lot of trips for no apparent reason you d be well advised to check your wiring before deciding that the gfci is broken or useless subject what is the difference between a gfci outlet and a gfci breaker for most situations you can use either a gfci outlet as the first device on the circuit or you can install a breaker with a built in gfci the former is generally preferred since gfci breakers are quite expensive for example an ordinary ge breaker costs us 5 the gfci model costs us 35 there is one major exception if you need to protect a multi wire branch circuit two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire such as a canadian style kitchen circuit you ll need a multi pole gfci breaker unfortunately these are expensive the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars depending on what brand of panel box you have but if you must protect such a circuit say for a pool heater you have no choice one more caveat gfci outlets are bulky you may want to use an oversize box when installing them on second thought use large actually deep boxes everywhere you ll thank yourself for it incidentally if you re installing a gfci to ensure that one specific outlet is protected such as a bathroom you don t really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet in the bathroom and not gfci anything upstream of it but protecting the whole circuit is preferred when you install a gfci it s a good idea to use the little ground fault protected stickers that come with it and mark the outlets downstream of the gfci you can figure out which outlets are downstream simply by tripping the gfci with the test button and see which outlets are dead subject what s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet then apart from their use in electronics which we won t comment on and for certain fluorescent lights they won t turn on without a good ground connection they re intended to guard against insulation failures within the device generally the case of the appliance is connected to the ground lead if there s an insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case the ground lead conducts the electricity away safely and possibly trips the circuit breaker in the process if the case is not grounded and such a short occurs the case is live and if you touch it while you re grounded you ll get zapped of course if the circuit is gfci protected it will be a very tiny zap which is why you can use gfcis to replace ungrounded outlets both nec and cec there are some appliances that should never be grounded in particular that applies to toasters and anything else with exposed conductors consider if you touch the heating electrode in a toaster and you re not grounded nothing will happen if you re slightly grounded you ll get a small shock the resistance will be too high but if the case were grounded and you were holding it you d be the perfect path to ground subject why is one prong wider than the other polarization nowadays many two prong devices have one prong wider than the other this is so that the device could rely not guaranteed on one specific wire being neutral and the other hot this is particularly advantageous in light fixtures where the the shell should neutral safety or other devices which want to have an approximate ground reference ie some radios most 2 prong extension cords have wide prongs too this requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right way around you want the wide prong to be neutral and the narrow one hot most outlets have a darker metal for the hot screw and lighter coloured screw for the neutral if not you can usually figure out which is which by which prong the terminating screw connects to subject what kind of outlets do i need in a kitchen the nec requires at least two 20 amp small appliance circuits for kitchens the cec requires split duplex receptacles outlets must be installed such that no point is more than 24 nec 900 mm cec from an outlet every counter wider than 12 nec or 300 mm cec must have at least one outlet the circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except in the kitchen pantry or dining room furthermore these circuits are in addition to any required for refrigerators stoves microwaves lighting etc non dedicated outlets within 6 of a sink must be protected by a gfci nec only split duplex receptacles are fed with a 220v circuit the tab is broken on the hot side of the outlet and one hot goes to the upper outlet and the other hot goes to the lower outlet the neutral connects to both outlets through one screw when carrying through to another outlet the neutral must be pigtailed such that removing the outlet or having the neutral connection fall off doesn t cause the neutral to disconnect from downstream outlets subject where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms there must be at least one outlet in each bathroom adjacent to the sink in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in the light fixture all such outlets must be gfci protected subject what is romex nm nmd what is bx when should i use each romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire sometimes called non metallic sheath the formal name is nm this is suitable for use in dry protected areas ie inside stud walls on the sides of joists etc that are not subject to mechanical damage or excessive heat most newer homes are wired almost exclusively with nm wire there are several different categories of nm cable bx cable technically known as armored cable or ac has a flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is fairly resistant to damage teck cable is ac with an additional external thermoplastic sheath protection for cable in concealed locations where nm or ac cable is run through studs joists or similar wooden members the outer surface of the cable must be kept at least 32mm 1 25 cec nec from the edges of the wooden members or the cable should be protected from mechanical injury this latter protection can take the form of metal plates such as spare outlet box ends or conduit note inspector permitted practise in canada suggests that armored cable or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection but this is technically illegal additional protection recommendations these are rules in the canadian codes they are reasonable answers to the vague references to exposed to mechanical damage in both the nec and cec nm cable should be protected against mechanical damage where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls in exposed locations under 5 feet from the floor ie use ac instead flexible conduit wooden guards etc where cable is suspended as in connections to furnaces or water heaters the wire should be protected canadian practise is usually to install a junction or outlet box on the wall and use a short length of ac cable or nm cable in flexible conduit to jump to the appliance stapling nm to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used where nm cable is run in close proximity to heating ducts or pipe heat transfer should be minimized by means of a 25mm 1 air space or suitable insulation material a wad of fiberglass nm cable shall be supported within 300mm 1 of every box or fitting and at intervals of no more than 1 5m 5 holes in joists or studs are considered supports some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to each box while fishing cable is technically in violation it is permitted where proper support is impractical 2 conductor nm cable should never be stapled on edge knight also insists on only one cable per staple referring to the workmanship clause but this seems more honoured in the breach cable should never be buried in plaster cement or similar finish cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more than 1m 39 whenever bx cable is terminated at a box with a clamp small plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through the insulation bx is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by solid wall coverings in places where damage is more likely like on the back wall of a garage you may be required to use conduit a ul or csa approved metal pipe you use various types of fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance exit for the wire service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit in damp places eg buried wiring to outdoor lighting you will need special wire eg cec nmw90 nec uf nmw90 looks like very heavy duty nmd90 you will usually need short lengths of conduit where the wire enters exits the ground see underground wiring section thermoplastic sheath wire such as nm nmw etc should not be exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that purpose many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through furnace ducts including cold air return plenums constructed by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces the reason for this is that if there s a fire the ducting will spread toxic gasses from burning insulation very rapidly through the building teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas canada appears to use similar wire designations to the us except that canadian wire designations usually include the temperature rating in celsius eg ac90 versus ac in the us nm b is 90 degrees celcius note local codes vary this is one of the items that changes most often eg chicago codes require conduit everywhere there are very different requirements for mobile homes check your local codes especially if you re doing anything that s the slightest out of the ordinary wire selection table incomplete the real tables are enormous uncommon wire types or applications omitted condition type cec nec exposed concealed dry plastic nmd90 nm armor ac90 ac teck90 exposed concealed damp plastic nmd90 nmc armor acwu90 teck90 exposed concealed wet plastic nmwu90 armor acwu90 teck90 exposed to weather plastic nmwu tw etc armor teck90 direct earth burial plastic nmwu uf service entrance rwu twu armor ra90 teck90 acwu90 nmwu not for service entrance subject should i use plastic or metal boxes the nec permits use of plastic boxes with non metallic cable only the reasoning is simple with armored cable the box itself provides ground conductor continuity u s plastic boxes don t use metal cable clamps the cec is slightly different the cec never permits cable armor as a grounding conductor however you must still provide ground continuity for metallic sheath the cec also requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes the advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for non metallic sheathed cable you can avoid making one ground connection and they sometimes cost a little less on the other hand plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts for exposed or shop wiring metal boxes are probably better subject junction box positioning a junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together junction boxes must be located in such a way that they re accessible later ie not buried under plaster excessive use of junction boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation and inspectors may get nasty subject can i install a replacement light fixture in general one can replace fixtures freely subject to a few caveats first of course one should check the amperage rating of the circuit if your heart is set on installing half a dozen 500 watt floodlights you may need to run a new wire back to the panel box but there are some more subtle constraints as well for example older house wiring doesn t have high temperature insulation the excess heat generated by a ceiling mounted lamp can and will cause the insulation to deteriorate and crack with obvious bad results some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high temperature wire only you may find in fact that your ceiling wiring already has this problem in which case replacing any devices is a real adventure other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some fluorescent fixtures and making sure that the ceiling box and its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy chandelier or ceiling fan you may need to install a new box specifically listed for this purpose a 2x4 across the ceiling joists makes a good support metal brackets are also available that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and mounted between the joists there are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as pot lamps or heat lamps when these are installed in insulated ceilings they can present a very substantial fire hazard the cec provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated ceilings provided that the fixture is boxed in a coffin usually 8 x16 x12 made by making a pair of joists 12 high and covering with plywood that doesn t have any insulation yes that s 8 feet long nec rules are somewhat less stringent they require at least 3 clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation the rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement which means that a cec style coffin might be worthwhile presumably that s up to the local inspector the cec doesn t actually mandate the coffin per se this seems to be an inspector requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can t get accidentally buried in insulation ie if you have insulation blown in later there are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation they are usually limited to 75 watt bulbs and are unfortunately somewhat more expensive than the older types before you use them you should ensure that they have explicit ul or csa approval for such uses follow the installation instructions carefully the prescribed location for the sensor can vary there does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved for use in insulation the coffin appears the only legal approach subject what does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts this usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is loose depending on the load balance one hot wire may end up being more than 110v and the other less than 110v with respect to ground this is a very hazardous situation it can destroy your electronic equipment possibly start fires and in some situations electrocute you ie some us jurisdictions require the stove frame connected to neutral if this happens contact your electrical authority immediately and have them come and check out the problem note a brief 1 second brightening is sometimes normal with lighting and motors on the same 220v with neutral circuit a loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness far longer than one second in case of doubt get help subject what is 3 phase power should i use it can i get it in my house three phase power has three hot wires 120 degrees out of phase with each other these are usually used for large motors because it is more efficient provides a bit more starting torque and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper you re most likely to encounter a 3 phase circuit that shows 110 volts between any hot and ground and 208 volts between any two hots the latter shows the difference between a normal 220v 110v common neutral circuit which is 240 volts between the two hots there are 3 phase circuits with different voltages bringing in a 3 phase feed to your house is usually ridiculously expensive or impossible if the equipment you want to run has a standard motor mount it is much cheaper to buy a new 110v or 220v motor for it in some cases it is possible to run 3 phase equipment on ordinary power if you have a capacitor start unit or use a larger motor as a auto generator these are tricky but are a good solution if the motor is non standard size or too expensive or too big to replace the taunton press book the small shop has an article on how to do this if you must note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using such a converter the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that subject is it better to run motors at 110 or 220 theoretically it doesn t make any difference however there is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply wiring all things being equal a 220v motor will lose 4 times less power in the house wiring than a 110v motor this also means that the startup surge loss will be less and the motor will get to speed quicker and in some circumstances the smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life this is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more than 50 feet long subject what is this nonsense about 3hp on 110v 15a circuits it is a universal physical law that 1 hp is equal to 746 watts given heating loss power factor and other inefficiencies it is usually best to consider 1 hp is going to need 1000 1200 watts a 110v 15a circuit can only deliver 1850 watts to a motor so it cannot possibly be more than approximately 2 hp given rational efficiency factors 1 5hp is more like it some equipment manufacturers sears in particular most router manufacturers in general advertise a hp rating that is far in excess of what is possible they are giving you a stall horsepower or similar that means the power is measured when the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load what they don t mention is that if you kept it in that condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker will trip otherwise the motor will melt it s drawing far more current than it can continuously when comparing motors compare the continuous horsepower this should be on the motor nameplate if you can t find that figure check the amperage rating which is always present subject how do i convert two prong receptacles to three prong older homes frequently have two prong receptacles instead of the more modern three these receptacles have no safety ground and the cabling usually has no ground wire neither the nec or cec permits installing new 2 prong receptacles anymore there are several different approaches to solving this 1 if the wiring is done through conduit or bx and the conduit is continuous back to the panel you can connect the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle box nec mainly cec frowns on this practise 2 if there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby and it s continuous to the main house ground point you can run a conductor to it from the third prong 3 run a ground conductor back to the main panel 4 easiest install a gfci receptacle the ground lug should not be connected to anything but the gfci protection itself will serve instead the gfci will also protect downstream possibly also two prong outlets if you do this to protect downstream outlets the grounds must not be connected together since it wouldn t be connected to a real ground a wiring fault could energize the cases of 3 prong devices connected to other outlets be sure though that there aren t indirect ground plug connections such as via the sheath on bx cable the cec permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three prong if you fill the u ground with a non conducting goop like caulking compound this is not permitted in the nec subject are you sure about gfcis and ungrounded outlets should the test button work we re sure about what the nec and cec say remember though that your local codes may vary as for the test button there s a resistor connecting the load side of the hot wire to the line side of the neutral wire when you press the test button current through this resistor shows up as an imbalance and trips the gfci this is a simple passive and reliable test and doesn t require a real ground to work if your gfci does not trip when you press the test button it is very probably defective or miswired again if the test button doesn t work something s broken and potentially dangerous the problem should be corrected immediately the instructions that come with some gfcis specify that the ground wire must be connected we do not know why they say this the causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet or with the formalities of ul or csa listing perhaps the device was never tested without the ground wire being connected on the other hand ul or csa approval should only have been granted if the device behaves properly in all listed applications including ungrounded outlet replacement one of us called leviton their gfcis are labeled for installation on grounded circuits only the technician was surprised to see that he agreed that the nec does not require it and promised to investigate subject how should i wire my shop as with any other kind of wiring you need enough power for all devices that will be on simultaneously the code specifies that you should stay under 80 of the nominal capacity of the circuit for typical home shop use this means one circuit for the major power tools and possibly one for a dust collector or shop vac use at least 12 gauge wire many power tools have big motors with a big start up surge if you can use 20 amp breakers nec though cec requires standard 20a receptacles which means you d have to replug all your equipment lights should either be on a circuit of their own and not shared with circuits in the rest of the house or be on at least two separate circuits the idea is that you want to avoid a situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand rpm while you re groping in the dark for the off switch do install lots of outlets it s easier to install them in the beginning when you don t have to cut into an existing cable it s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time as the tool you really want but use metal boxes and plates and maybe even metal sheathed cable you may have objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit wrong note that some jurisdictions have a no horizontal wiring rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used for working what this means is that all wiring must be run along structural members ie stapled to studs other possible shop circuits include heater circuits 220v circuits for some large tools and air compressor circuits don t overload circuits and don t use extension cords if you can help it unless they re rated for high currents a coiled extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of the same gauge also the insulation won t withstand as much heat and heat dissipation is the critical issue if your shop is located at some remove from your main panel you should probably install a subpanel and derive your shop wiring from it if you have young children you may want to equip this panel with a cut off switch and possibly a lock if you want to install individual switches to safe particular circuits make sure you get ones rated high enough for example ordinary light switches are not safely able to handle the start up surge generated by a table saw buy horsepower rated switches instead finally note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished basements hence the nec requirements for gfcis apply and even if you know that you d never use one of your shop outlets to run a lawn mower the next owner of your house might have a different idea note fine woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop wiring april 1992 is one place to start subject underground wiring you will need to prepare a trench to specifications use special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tubing and possibly lumber don t use creosoted lumber it rots thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion of lead the transition from in house to underground wire is generally via conduit all outdoor boxes must be specifically listed for the purpose and contain the appropriate gaskets fittings etc if the location of the box is subject to immersion in water a more serious style of water proof box is needed and of course don t forget the gfcis the required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specific situation a hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says buried power line and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed subject aluminum wiring during the 1970 s aluminum instead of copper wiring became quite popular and was extensively used since that time aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations we recommend even if you re allowed to that do not use it for new wiring but don t panic if your house has aluminum wiring aluminum wiring when properly installed can be just as safe as copper aluminum wiring is however very unforgiving of improper installation we will cover a bit of the theory behind potential problems and what you can do to make your wiring safe the main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as cold creep when aluminum wiring warms up it expands when it cools down it contracts unlike copper when aluminum goes through a number of warm cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each time to make the problem worse aluminum oxidises or corrodes when in contact with certain types of metal so the resistance of the connection goes up which causes it to heat up and corrode oxidize still more eventually the wire may start getting very hot melt the insulation or fixture it s attached to and possibly even cause a fire since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move into a house built during the 70 s we will cover basic points of safe aluminum wiring we suggest that if you re considering purchasing a home with aluminum wiring or have discovered it later that you hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring for the following things 1 fixtures eg outlets and switches directly attached to aluminum wiring should be rated for it the device will be stamped with al cu or co alr the latter supersedes the former but both are safe these fixtures are somewhat more expensive than the ordinary ones 2 wires should be properly connected at least 3 4 way around the screw in a clockwise direction connections should be tight while repeated tightening of the screws can make the problem worse during the inspection it would pay off to snug up each connection note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the main service entrance cable it should be inspected 3 push in terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire any connections using push in terminals should be redone with the proper screw connections immediately 4 there should be no signs of overheating darkened connections melted insulation or baked fixtures any such damage should be repaired 5 connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be handled specially current canadian codes require that the wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting aluminum to copper the nec requires that the wire be connected together using special crimp devices with an anti oxidant grease the tools and materials for the latter are quite expensive not practical to do it yourself unless you can rent the tool 6 any non rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring by means of a short copper pigtail see 5 above 7 shows reasonable workmanship neat wiring properly stripped not nicked wire etc if when considering purchasing a home an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two we believe that you can consider the wiring safe if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere if the wrong receptacles are used you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtails having this professionally done can range from 3 to 10 per receptacle switch you can do this yourself too subject i m buying a house what should i do congratulations but it s generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas not just for wiring but plumbing and structural as well if an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor ones we believe that you can consider the wiring safe after any minor problems are fixed if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere here s some hints on what to look for obvious non code wiring can include zip cord wiring either concealed or nailed to walls hot wiring on the identified neutral conductor without proper marking ungrounded grounding outlets except when downstream of a gfci splices hanging in mid air other than proper knob and tube switched neutrals unsecured romex swinging about like grapevines certain wiring practises that are actually to code or were at one time sometimes reveal diy wiring that may have hidden violations switches that seem to control nothing abandoned perhaps not properly terminated wiring a wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are separately controlled by other wall switches except when it s really convenient switches and outlets in bizarre locations great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or ceiling backwrapped grounding wires subject what is this weird stuff old style wiring in the years since edison invented electricity several different wiring styles have come and gone when you buy an older home you may encounter some of this stuff this section describes the old methods and some of their idiosyncrasies the oldest wiring system you re likely to encounter is called knob and tube k t it is made up of individual conductors with a cloth insulation the wires are run along side structural members eg joists or studs using ceramic stand offs knobs wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes connections were made by twisting the wire together soldering and wrapping with tape since the hot and neutral were run separately the wiring tends to be rather confusing a neutral often runs down the centre of each room with taps off to each fixture the hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next in some cases k t isn t colour coded so the neutral is often the same colour as the hot wires you ll see k t in homes built as late as the 40 s comments on k t the people installing k t were pretty paranoid about electricity so the workmanship tends to be pretty good the wire insulation and insulators tend to stand up very well most k t i ve seen for example is in quite good condition no grounding grounding is usually difficult to install boxes are small receptacle replacement particularly with gfci can be difficult no bushing on boxes either so wiring changes need special attention to box entry sometimes the neutral isn t balanced very well between separately hot circuits so it is sometimes possible to overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on any circuit building code does not permit insulation in walls that contain k t connection to existing k t from new circuits can be tricky consult your inspector modern wiring practise requires considerably more outlets to be installed than k t systems did since k t tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn t necessary to replace it simply because it s k t what you should watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and be cautious about circuit loading in many cases it s perfectly reasonable to leave existing k t alone and add new fixtures on new circuits using modern techniques after k t they invented multi conductor cable the first type you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation it looks much like the romex cable of the last decade or two this stuff was used in the 40 s and 50 s again no grounding conductor it was installed much like modern wiring its major drawback is that this type of insulation embrittles we ve seen whole systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a touch bx cable of the same vintage has similar problems this stuff is very fragile and becomes rather hazardous if the wires become bare this wiring should be left untouched as much as possible whenever an opportunity arises replace it a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat shrink tubing after this wiring technique the more modern romex was invented it s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth often a bit sticky this stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn t present a hazard and is reasonably easy to work with it does not need to be replaced it should be considered as safe as the modern stuff thermoplastic insulation wire just don t abuse it too much subject where do i buy stuff try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you their prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or diy centres have better quality materials have wider variety including the odd stuff and have people behind the counter that know what you re talking about cultivate friendly knowledgeable sales people they ll give you much valuable information

2 | i don t react to scallops but did have discomforts with clam juice served at american waterfront seafood bars i don t know whether the juice is homemade or from cans the following is my first encounter with the chinese restaurant syndrome ten years ago about an hour after having won ton soup i collapsed in a chair with my face feeling puffed up my scalp tingling my feet too weak to stand up the symptoms lasted for about 20 minutes determined to find out the cause of my first reaction i went back to the chinese restuarant and ordered the same dish the same thing happened a quick look inside the kitchen revealed nothing out of the ordinary

dealing with space and astronomy may be found on the net a few sites offer direct dialup access or remote login access while the remainder support some form of file transfer many sites are listed as providing anonymous ftp this refers to the file transfer protocol on the internet sites not connected to the internet cannot use ftp directly but there are a few automated ftp servers which operates via email send mail containing only the word help to ftpmail decwrl dec com or bitftp pucc princeton edu and the servers will send you instructions on how to make requests the sources with the broadest selection of material are the nasa ames space archive and the national space science data center don t even ask for images to be posted to the net the data volume is huge and nobody wants to

3 | archive name space controversy last modified date 93 04 01 14 39 06 controversial questions these issues periodically come up with much argument and few facts being offered the summaries below attempt to represent the position on which much of the net community has settled please don t bring them up again unless there s something truly new to be discussed the net can t set public policy that s what your representatives are for what happened to the saturn v plans despite a widespread belief to the contrary the saturn v blueprints have not been lost they are kept at marshall space flight center on microfilm the problem in re creating the saturn v is not finding the drawings it is finding vendors who can supply mid 1960 s vintage hardware like guidance system components and the fact that the launch pads and vab have been converted to space shuttle use so you have no place to launch from by the time you redesign to accommodate available hardware and re modify the launch pads you may as well have started from scratch with a clean sheet design why data from space missions isn t immediately available investigators associated with nasa missions are allowed exclusive access for one year after the data is obtained in order to give them an opportunity to analyze the data and publish results without being scooped by people uninvolved in the mission however nasa frequently releases examples in non digital form e g photos to the public early in a mission risks of nuclear rtg power sources for space probes there has been extensive discussion on this topic sparked by attempts to block the galileo and ulysses launches on grounds of the plutonium thermal sources being dangerous numerous studies claim that even in worst case scenarios shuttle explosion during launch or accidental reentry at interplanetary velocities the risks are extremely small two interesting data points are 1 the may 1968 loss of two snap 19b2 rtgs which landed intact in the pacific ocean after a nimbus b weather satellite failed to reach orbit the fuel was recovered after 5 months with no release of plutonium 2 in april 1970 the apollo 13 lunar module reentered the atmosphere and its snap 27 rtg heat source which was jettisoned fell intact into the 20 000 feet deep tonga trench in the pacific ocean the corrosion resistant materials of the rtg are expected to prevent release of the fuel for a period of time equal to 10 half lives of the pu 238 fuel or about 870 years doe 1980 to make your own informed judgement some references you may wish to pursue are a good review of the technical facts and issues is given by daniel salisbury in radiation risk and planetary exploration the rtg controversy planetary report may june 1987 pages 3 7 another good article which also reviews

are responsible for a significant amount of damage to the ozone layer studies indicate that they in reality have only a minute impact both in absolute terms and relative to other chemical sources the remainder of this item is a response from the author of the quoted study charles jackman the atmospheric modelling study of the space shuttle effects on the stratosphere involved three independent theoretical groups and was organized by dr michael prather nasa goddard institute for space studies the three groups involved michael prather and maria garcia nasa giss charlie jackman and anne douglass nasa goddard space flight center and malcolm ko and dak sze atmospheric and environmental research inc the effort was to look at the effects of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere the following are the estimated sources of stratospheric chlorine industrial sources 300 000 000 kilograms year natural sources 75 000 000 kilograms year shuttle sources 725 000 kilograms year the shuttle source assumes 9 space shuttles and 6 titan rockets are launched yearly thus the launches would add less than 0 25 to the total stratospheric chlorine sources the effect on ozone is minimal global yearly average total ozone would be decreased by 0 0065 this is much less than total ozone variability associated with volcanic activity and solar flares the influence of human made chlorine products on ozone is computed by atmospheric model calculations to be a 1 decrease in globally averaged ozone between 1980 and 1990 the influence of the space shuttle and titan rockets on the stratosphere is negligible the launch schedule of the space shuttle and titan rockets would need to be increased by over a factor of a hundred in order to have about the same effect on ozone as our increases in industrial halocarbons do at the present time theoretical results of this study have been published in _the space shuttle s impact on the stratosphere_ mj prather mm garcia ar douglass ch

bancroft j e dunn eds report sam tr 65 48 june 1965 usaf school of aerospace medicine brooks afb texas how the challenger astronauts died the challenger shuttle launch was not destroyed in an explosion this is a well documented fact see the rogers commission report for example what looked like an explosion was fuel burning after the external tank came apart the forces on the crew cabin were not sufficient to kill the astronauts never mind destroy their bodies according to the kerwin team s medical forensic report the astronauts were killed when the more or less intact cabin hit the water at circa 200mph and their bodies then spent several weeks underwater their remains were recovered and after the kerwin team examined them they were sent off to be buried using the shuttle beyond low earth orbit you can t use the shuttle orbiter for missions beyond low earth orbit because it can t get there it is big and heavy and does not carry enough fuel even if you fill part of the cargo bay with tanks furthermore it is not particularly sensible to do so because much of that weight is things like wings which are totally useless except in the immediate vicinity of the earth the shuttle orbiter is highly specialized for travel between earth s surface and low orbit taking it higher is enormously costly and wasteful a much better approach would be to use shuttle subsystems to build a specialized high orbit spacecraft yet another concise answer by henry spencer the face on mars there really is a big rock on mars that looks remarkably like a humanoid face it appears in two different frames of viking orbiter imagery 35a72 much more facelike in appearance and the one more often published with the sun 10 degrees above western horizon and 70a13 with the sun 27 degrees from the west science writer richard hoagland has championed the idea that the face is artificial intended to resemble a human and erected by an extraterrestrial civilization most other analysts concede that the resemblance is most likely accidental other viking images show a smiley faced crater and a lava flow resembling kermit the frog elsewhere on mars there exists a mars anomalies research society sorry don t know the address to study the face the mars observer mission will carry an extremely high resolution camera and better images of the formation will hopefully settle this question in a few years

1 | the father of a friend of mine is a police officer in west virginia not only is his word as a skilled observer good in court but his skill as an observer has been tested to be more accurate than the radar gun in some cases no foolin he can guess a car s speed to within 2 3mph just by watching it blow by whether he s standing still or moving too yes i realize that calibrated guns are more accurate than this but his ability is not that uncommon among people who watch moving things for a living i have heard so what good is a radar detector except to give you a split second warning that the guy who just cut you off to pass the guy ahead and to your left is about to panic stop from 85 on a crowded freeway
2 | where did you read this i don t think this is true i think most medical treatments are based on science although it is difficult to prove anything with certitude it is true that there are some things that have just been found to work but we have no good explanation for why but almost everything does have a scientific rationale the most common treatment for prostate cancer is probably hormone therapy it has been proven to work so have radiation and chemotherapy what treatments did the article say are not proven gordon banks n3jxp skepticism is the chastity of the intellect and geb cadre dsl pitt edu it is shameful to surrender it too soon
3 | okay here is what i have so far have a group any size preferibly small but send a human being to the moon set up a habitate and have the human s spend one earth year on the moon does that mean no resupply or need to find atleast 1billion for prize money contest open to different classes of participants new mexico state has semi challenged university of alaska any branch to put a team together and to do it any other university college institute of higher learning wish to make a counter challenge or challenge another school say it here i like the idea of having atleast a russian team some prefer using new technology others old or the basic idea of the new moon race is like the solar car race acrossed australia atleast in that basic vein of endevour any other suggestions

3 | i aint talking the large or even the mining companies i am talking the small miners the people who have themselves and a few employees if at all the people who go out every year and set up thier sluice box and such and do mining the semi old fashion way okay they use modern methods toa point i am talking the guy who coem to nome evry year sets up his tent on the beach the beach was washed away last year and sets up his her sluice box and goes at it mining i know the large corps such as alaska gold company might complain to my opinions are what i learn at the local bs table my original thing idea was that the way to get space mining was to allow the eco freaks thier way as they have done with other mineral development you can t in many places can t go to the bathroom in the woods without some form of regulation covering it
2 | for several years i have been dealing with reccurring corneal erosion there does not seem to be much known about the cause of such a problem my current episode is pretty bad since it is located in the middle of the cornea if it s bad enough the usual treatment for it is puncture therapy however my doctor this time is trying to let it heal by itself by putting a contact lens to protect the area apparently the problem is not that common but i d be curious if anyone else out there has a similar problem perhaps to see if a cause can be found

1 | there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here a few points need to be clarified the equipment grounding conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods is used as a safety ground to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects it should never except for a few exceptions to be discussed later carry the normal operating current of a connected load some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation orange outlets are often used for this with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and in many cases back to the service anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems the code requires the insulated grounding conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box and if required back all the way to the service entrance where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either the grounded conductor of a circuit often called the neutral which is referred to in the code as the identified conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point generally at the service entrance panel this connection is through the main bonding jumper in many household service panels the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel the grounded conductor neutral is generally a current carrying conductor in the case of a 120 volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the grounding conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load under normal operating conditions if you should incorrectly connect the grounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end if the load equipment has a metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the u ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential the difference under normal non short circuit conditions may be only a few tenths of a volt but it could also be a volt or two this normally does not present a shock hazard however if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe a radiator a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path if the contact is not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong conditions this arcing could start a fire it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size causing it to overheat with the incorrect non single point grounding of the neutral if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor which increases the possibility for shock or fire also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment often causing malfunction i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling this is done primarily for lightning protection so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer some of it flows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the hot conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy don t flame me on this i m just telling you where the field comes from not it s health effect as far as i m concerned the jury is still out on this note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel not at any sub distribution panels this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground with the possible problems listed above the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from one building to another in the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of a seperate wire every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review these exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the days before u ground outlets and such the appliance manufacturers don t want to have to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors don t want to have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in place of three wire to the appliances no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings since most current is in the 220 volt hots except at some low settings the wires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage so far the exceptions have survived in the case of feeds between buildings it s primarily for lightning protection people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn t a legal grounding conductor obviously the bare wire in romex with ground is anywhere there is a green wire installed such as in a portable cord that is a good grounding conductor the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor in the us bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends you don t have to bond it to anything it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwall tubing is generally a legal grounding conductor but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for larger pipes greenfield looks like big bx but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it is not a legal grounding conductor as it doesn t have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield wiremold is also not a legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact and the feed to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were hot with 120 volts why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring conduit bx etc where you can bond the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever on another issue while you should ground the green wire lug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don t install it the interrupter doesn t depend on the ground to trip it is desirable to connect the ground if available because if the ground is connected the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in whereas without the ground it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path for those questioning the legal use of ungrounded gcfi s read in the nec 210 7 d exception this is the 1990 code my 93 code is in the city but i know the rule hasn t changed it might be renumbered though we have only touched the surface concerning grounding there is much more to this subject but most of you have fallen asleep by now john
1 | i was also sceptical about the amps being built in the far east or where ever but if you look in the amp and see what components they use and how it was designed you can easily see why the amplifiers sound so brilliant good point also i wouldn t be surprised that the components they use off shore are of inferior quality as long as it was properly designed and robust premium components are used it shouldn t matter where it is assembled definately i agree wholeheartedly if they can build the amp where the labour is not so expensive they can afford to put decent components in and go to more effort to improve the design of the amplifier as adcom has done i cannot see why people say the amplifier won t last not with those quality components inside sure the amp runs very fairly hot but that s how you get an amp to sound incredibly good an amp that runs hot has no bearing on how it s gonna sound the amp you have probably is running class a the whole day actually i d be wary of excessively hot amps cauz even though the components inside may be rated to run that way excessive heat will dramatically shorten the life of any electronic component regardless of quality in fact an amp that does run hot to the touch is because either the engineer or manufacturer of that amp wanted to skimp on heatsinking or cooling to save costs hmmmmm sure i didn t mean to imply that because of the heat generated the amp sounds good my adcom gfp 535ii runs fairly warm not hot to the touch but enough to satisfy me that the amp is running nicely i don t like it when an amp runs dead cold it makes one think that the amp is doing nothing the heatsinks that adcom uses in their amps are certainly far for skimpy they re massive things with heating vents both below and above more than enough to carry away excessive heat my opinions once again

1 | this probably only tells you that the dc blocking capacitor that s in series between the one chip single ended audio amp and the speaker terminal is there open it up and look for the power amp ics they ll be fairly obvious replace the one connected to the dead output well one thing you should do is poke around the terminals of the power amp chips use a probe with a 10m resistor like a scope probe connected to the input of a small audio amp w speaker if you find line level input to both chips one of the chips is bad and can probably replaced pretty easily if you want to pick off a near line level signal suitable for feeding to an outboard amp the outer legs of the volume control pot will often be good enough this is before the volume control and usually before the tone and balance controls too if you take off from the center and ground legs of the volume pot this will be after the volume control but again probably before the other controls if the unit is a modern type with an electronic volume control chip you should probably forget the whole thing

1 | i ve used on chip capacitors to reduce ground bounce noise on a small systolic array chip that had 50pf loads on the clock lines design was in 2 micron n well cmos using the mosis scalable design rules here are some thoughts on the bypass capacitors 1 they don t help much with simultaneous output switching there is still a large inductance between the bypass capacitor and the load capacitor on both the signal line and the ground return so you still get ground and power line bounce 2 they do help a lot with on chip loads as i had with the high load on the clock lines 3 the transients you are trying to suppress are really high frequency so forget about large areas of poly thin oxide diff capacitors since the rc time constant is too large what i did is to make a metal2 metal poly diff sandwich but put a lot of holes in the poly layer allowing frequent diff metal1 contacts i forget exactly how wide the poly lines were if i were doing this design again i d probably omit the diff altogether and use a solid poly sheet instead using just m2 m1 and poly and substrate but that has such a high resistance it can be ignored at these speeds 4 you are probably better off trying to tune your circuit to run with slightly slower edges and lower voltage swings especially for output signalling than spending chip area on capacitors i had spare space on the die since the circuit was too big for a mosis tiny chip and the next size up was twice as big as i needed kevin karplus kevin karplus karplus ce ucsc edu

sent in a donation for the mednews ocr scanner fund we have reached our goal a hewlett packard scanjet iip was purchased this week thank you to the following individuals whose contributions i just received john sorenson carol sigelman carla moore barbara moose judith schrier again thank you to all who gave i have been using wordscan plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to review the product wordscan plus is a product of calera recognition systems it runs under windows 3 1 and supports that accufont technology of the hewlett packard scanners when initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options 1 text graphics 2 input source ie scanner fax file disk file 3 automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image i like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document i would like scanned and in what order once an image is scanned you can bring up the pop up image verification the software gives you two errors at this point blue which are words that were converted reliability but do not match anything in the built in dictionary yellow shade which are words that wordscan plus doesn t think it converted correctly at all i have found that the software should give itself more credit it is usually correct instead of wrong if a word is shaded blue you can add it to your personal dictionary the only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about 200 words i find this to be very limited considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary after a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate tiff or pcx file format i was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files i use hicnet medical newsletter page 1 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 an intel satisfaxtion card which stores incoming faxs in a pcx dcx format while most of my faxes were received in standard mode 200x100 dpi the accuracy of wordscan plus was excellent overall a very impressive product the only fault i could find is the limitations of the size of the user dictionary 200 specialized words is just too small if anyone has any specific questions please do not hesitate to send me email hicnet medical newsletter page 2 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 centers for disease control and prevention mmwr emerging infectious diseases source mmwr 42 14 date apr 16 1993 introduction despite predictions earlier this century that infectious diseases would soon be eliminated as a public health problem 1 infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states since the early 1970s the u s public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes e g escherichia coli o157 h7 hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency virus legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis tb have increased in many areas furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis tb and staphylococcal infections 2 emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings e g hospitals and child day care centers and minority and underserved populations the substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the u s health care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs 3 this issue of mmwr introduces a new series emerging infectious diseases future articles will address these diseases as well as surveillance control and prevention efforts by health care providers and public health officials this first

epidemiology epidemiology program office enteric diseases br div of bacterial and mycotic diseases national center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note e coli o157 h7 is a pathogenic gram negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in 1982 during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers 2 this pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus the most common cause of acute renal failure in children outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated 3 preliminary data from a cdc 2 year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e coli o157 h7 that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of 10 participating hospitals and was isolated from 7 8 of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e coli o157 h7 often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on hicnet medical newsletter page 7 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 smac medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection 4 the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications illness usually resolves after 6 8 days but 2 7 of patients develop hus which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of 3 5 this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of e coli o157 h7 in the absence of routine surveillance despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington 1 clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e coli o157 h7 using smac agar 5 when infections with e coli o157 h7 are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further cases e coli o157 h7 lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter cdc is collaborating with the u s department of agriculture s food safety inspection service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as e coli o157 h7 entering the meat supply because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated the optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are clear in this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role the food and drug administration fda has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to 155 f 86 1 c fda personal communication 1993 regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by e coli o157 h7 and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e coli o157 h7

if young persons who currently use smokeless tobacco continue to use these products frequently 1 to monitor trends in the prevalence of use of smokeless tobacco products cdc s 1991 national health interview survey health promotion and disease prevention supplement nhis hpdp collected information on snuff and chewing tobacco use and smoking from a representative sample of the u s civilian noninstitutionalized population aged greater than or equal to 18 years this report summarizes findings from this survey the 1991 nhis hpdp supplement asked have you used snuff at least 20 times in your entire life and do you use snuff now similar questions were asked about chewing tobacco use and cigarette smoking current users of smokeless tobacco were defined as those who reported snuff or chewing tobacco use at least 20 times and who reported using snuff or chewing tobacco at the time of the interview former users were defined as those who reported having used snuff or chewing tobacco at least 20 times and not using either at the time of the interview ever users of smokeless tobacco included current and former users current smokers were defined as those who reported smoking at least 100 cigarettes and who were currently smoking and former smokers as those who reported having smoked at least 100 cigarettes and who were not smoking now ever smokers included current and former smokers data on smokeless tobacco use were available for 43 732 persons aged greater than or equal to 18 years and were adjusted for nonresponse and weighted to provide national estimates confidence intervals cis were calculated by using standard errors generated by the software for survey data analysis sudaan 3 in 1991 an estimated 5 3 million 2 9 u s adults were current users of smokeless

of marketing strategies by tobacco companies that link smokeless tobacco with athletic performance and virility use of oral snuff has risen markedly among professional baseball players encouraging this behavior among adolescent and young adult males and increasing their risk for nicotine addiction oral cancer and other mouth disorders 4 differences in the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use among racial ethnic groups may be influenced by differences in educational levels and socioeconomic status as well as social and cultural phenomena that require further explanation for example targeted marketing practices may play a role in maintaining or increasing prevalence among some groups and affecting the differential initiation of smokeless tobacco use by young persons 5 6 in this report one concern is that nearly one fourth of current smokeless tobacco users also smoke cigarettes in the 1991 nhis hpdp the prevalence of cigarette smoking was higher among former smokeless tobacco users than among current and never smokeless tobacco users in a previous study among college students 18 of current smokeless tobacco users smoked hicnet medical newsletter page 11 volume 6 number 10 april 20 1993 occasionally 7 in addition approximately 7 of adults who formerly smoked reported substituting other tobacco products for cigarettes in an effort to stop smoking 8 health care providers should recognize the potential health implications of concurrent smokeless tobacco and cigarette use the national health objectives for the year 2000 have established special population target groups for the reduction of the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use including males aged 12 24 years to no more than 4 by the year 2000 objective 3 9 and american indian alaskan native youth to no more than 10 by the year 2000 objective 3 9a 9 strategies to lower the prevalence of smokeless tobacco use include continued monitoring of smokeless tobacco use integrating smoking and smokeless tobacco control efforts enforcing laws that restrict minors access to tobacco making excise taxes commensurate with those on cigarettes encouraging health care providers to routinely provide cessation advice and follow up providing school based prevention and cessation interventions and adopting policies that prohibit tobacco use on school property and at school sponsored events 5 references 1

1 | firstly i would never consider trying to make a one shot timer your 2f2 cap will have been designed as a ram battery substitute rather than for use in applications where you wish to drain the cap with a constant current their performance in some respects is more akin to batteries than to a normal cap the other point is that big electro s are usually rated with 5 20 tolerances so calculating exactly what capacitance you have particularly when considering the cold you should be looking at designing a micropower oscillator and divider chain that rolls over from zero to maximum count or vice versa once every 1 209 600 seconds if you were to use something like a 110hz clock you would need a divider chain of 2 27 to give an error of less than one percent in the firing times over the six week period of course you could trim the 110hz oscillator to give you exact time but the likelyhood of the oscillator remaining exactly constant at 40 is low anyway i would suspect that there would be far more battrey drain in firing the solenoid than there would be in the timer circuit caveat i m not experienced in low temperature electronics so i can t guarantee that this or any other approach is the best for inhospitable conditions johnh _ _ _ _ _ _ _ electronics department _ _ _ _ _ school of mpce macquarie university sydney australia 2109 email johnh mpce mq edu au ph 61 2 805 8959 fax 61 2 805 8983

take a break every so often the better ones also include advice on exercises posture and workstation setup some use sound hardware to warn of a break others use beeps or screen messages often rsi appears only after many years of typing and the pain has a delayed action in the short term too frequently you can be typing all day with little problem and the pain gets worse in the evening these tools act as an early warning system by listening to their warnings and taking breaks with exercises you don t have to wait for your body to give you a more serious and painful warning that is getting

description aimed at preventing rsi this program warns you to take breaks after a configurable interval based on clock time or after a set number of keystrokes whichever is earlier it gives you 3 exercises to do each time randomly selected from a set of 70 exercises are apparently tuned to the type of work you do data entry word processing information processing exercises are illustrated and include quite a lot of text on how to do the exercise and on what exactly the exercise does chb includes hypertext information on rsi that you can use to learn more about rsi and how to prevent it other information on non rsi topics can be plugged into this hypertext viewer a full glossary of medical terms and jargon is included chb can be run in a dos box under windows but does not then warn you when to take a break it does not therefore appear useful when used with windows cost 79 95 quantity discounts site licenses comments the keystroke counting approach looks good it seems better to measure the activity that is causing you problems than to measure clock time or even typing time the marketing stuff is very good and includes some summaries of research papers as well as lots of arguments you can use to get your company to pay up for rsi management tools tool eyercise commercial software available from ran enterprises one woodland park dr haverhill ma 01830 us tel 800 451

exercises can configure which are included and how many repetitions you do breaks last from 3 to 7 minutes also includes online help on workplace ergonomics quote from their literature eyercise is a windows program that breaks up your day with periodic sets of stretches and visual training exercises the stretches work all parts of your body relieving tension and helping to prevent repetitive strain injury the visual training exercises will improve your peripheral vision and help to relieve eye strain together these help you to become more relaxed and productive the package includes the book _computers visual stress_ by edward c godnig o d and john s hacunda which describes the ergonomic setup for a computer workstation and provides procedures and exercises to promote healthy and efficient computer use cost 69 95 including shipping and handling quantity discounts for resellers free demo 5 outside us comments i have a copy of this and it works as advertised i would say it is better for rsi prevention than rsi management because it does not allow breaks at periods less than 30 minutes also it interrupts you based on clock time rather than typing time which is not so helpful unless you use the keyboard all day worked ok on windows 3 0 though it did occasionally crash with a uae not sure why also refused to work with the space bar on one pc and has one window

also the only tool with a redistributable demo so if you do get the demo post it on your local bulletin boards ftp servers and bitnet servers does not include general info on rsi and ergonomics but it does have the ability to step backward in the exercise sequence which is good for repeating the most helpful exercises tool typewatch freeware version 3 8 october 1992 available from email to richardd hoskyns co uk anonymous ftp soda berkeley edu pub typing injury typewatch shar platforms unix tested on sco sunos mach character and x window mode description this is a shell script that runs in the background and warns you to stop typing based on how long you have been continuously typing it does not provide exercises but it does check that you really do take a break and tells you when you can start typing again typewatch now tells you how many minutes you have been typing today each time it warns you which is useful so you know how much you really type it also logs information to a file that you can analyse or simply print out the warning message appears on your screen in character mode in a pop up window for x windows or as a zephyr message for those with athena stuff tim freeman tsf cs cmu edu has put in a lot of bug fixes extra features and support for x zephyr and mach not formally supported but email richardd hoskyns co uk for sco sunos character mode or tsf cs cmu edu for mach x window mode zephyr if you have problems or want to give feedback tool various calendar batch queue programs available from various sources platforms various description any calendar reminder program that warns you of an upcoming appointment can be turned into an ad hoc rsi management tool or any batch queue submission program that lets you submit a program to run at a specific time to display a message to the screen using windows as an example create a calendar file and include this filename in your win ini s load line so you get it on every startup of windows suppose you want to have breaks every 30 minutes starting from 9 am press f7 special time to enter an appointment enter 9 30 hit enter and type some text in saying what the break is for then press f5 to set an alarm on this entry and repeat for the next appointment by using windows recorder you can record the keystrokes that set up breaks throughout a day in a rec file put this file on your run line as above and you will then with a single keypress be able to set up your daily appointments with rsi exercises the above method should be adaptable to most calendar programs an example using batch jobs would be to submit a simple job that runs at 9 30 am and warns you to take a break this will depend a lot on your operating system while these approaches are not ideal they are a good way of forcing yourself to take a break if you can t get hold of a suitable rsi management tool if you are techie enough you might want to write a version of typewatch see above for your operating system using batch jobs or whatever fits best tool digital watches with count down timers available from various sources e g casio bp 100 description many digital watches have timers that count down from a settable number of minutes they usually reset easily to that number either manually or automatically while these are a very basic tool they are very useful if you are writing reading driving or doing anything away from a computer which can still cause or aggravate rsi the great advantage is that they remind you to break from whatever you are doing comments my own experience was that cutting down a lot on my typing led to my writing a lot more and still reading as much as ever which actually aggravated the rsi in my right arm though the left arm improved getting a count down timer watch has been very useful on some occasions where i write a lot in a day i have tried an old fashioned hour glass type egg timer but these are not much good because they do not give an audible warning of the end of the time period keyboard remapping tools these enable you to change your keyboard mapping so you can type one handedly or with a different two handed layout one handed typing tools may help but be very careful about how you use them if you keep the same overall typing workload you are simply doubling your hand use for the hand that you use for typing and may therefore make matters worse tool hsh public domain available from anonymous ftp soda berkeley edu pub typing injury hsh shar platforms unix don t know which ones description allows one handed typing and other general keyboard remappings only works through tty s so you can use it with a terminal or an xterm but not most x programs tool dvorak keyboard tools various available from anonymous ftp soda berkeley edu pub typing injury xdvorak c also built into windows 3 x description the dvorak keyboard apparently uses a more rational layout that involves more balanced hand use it may help prevent rsi a bit but you can also use it if you have rsi since it will slow down your typing a lot

3 | prb access digex com pat pontificated what i was getting at in my post is whether or not it might be possible to put enough brains on board future deep space probes for them to automatically avoid such things as looking at the sun or going into an uncontrolled tumble i heard once that the voyagers had a failsafe routine built in that essentially says if you never hear from earth again here s what to do this was a back up in the event a receiver burnt out but the probe could still send data limited but still some data since this would be a shutdown that may never be refunded for startup if some type of cosmic bem took out the probe it might not be such a big loss obviously you can t plan for everything but the most obvious things can be considered
2 | frequently of late i have been reacting to something added to restaurant foods what happens is that the inside of my throat starts to feel puffy like i have a cold and also at times the inside of my mouth especially the tongue and lips also feel puffy the situations around these symptoms almost always involve restaurants usually chinese the most notable cases a cheap chinese fast food chain a japanese steak house i had the steak and another chinese fast food chain where i saw the cook put about a tablespoon or two of what looked like sugar or salt into my fried rice i am under the impression that msg enhances flavor by causing the taste buds to swell if this is correct i do not find it unreasonable to assume that high doses of msg can cause other mouth tissues to swell also as the many of the occurances including two of the above involved beef and as beef is frequently tenderized with msg this is what i suspect as being the cause i wouldn t be at all surprised if toxicity studies of msg in animals showed it as being harmless as it would be very startling to hear a lab rat or rhesus monkey complain about their throats feeling funny anyone who wishes to explain how the majority of food additives are totally harmless is welcome to e mail me with the results of any studied they know of i will probably respond to them however with a reminder of how long it took to prove that smoking causes cancer which the tobacco companies still deny dm if i sound grumpy it s because i had beef with broccoli for lunch today and now it hurts to swallow dan myers madman if the creator had intended us to walk myers usceast cs scarolina edu upright he wouldn t have given us knuckles

1 | not according to the nec nor the cec as explained in the electrical wiring faq which i posted here separately note the material under the headings and of course as they said local codes may vary i m not sure about this if the ground connections on the outlets are connected to anything they should be connected to a wire that runs back to the main panel where it is bonded to the neutral connector and to the house ground rod a connection to a local earth ground would not necessarily meet one of the goals of the ground wire which is that if a short develops from hot to the ground wire enough current would flow to trip the breaker hmmm how are those orange isolated ground outlets often used in computer rooms wired

1 | hi i am looking for some help in choosing a package for a high speed silicon adc 100mhz currently being fabricated this is a phd research project and i have to test the chip at speed on a pcb i expect to have roughly 100 packaged circuits and will do dc low speed and high speed testing using 3 different set ups for the test chip i know for sure that a dip will not work the long lead lines have too high an inductance getting a custom made package is too expensive so i am trying to choose between a flatpak and a leadless chip carrier the flatpack would be hard to test since it has to be soldered on to the test setup and i would spend loads of time soldering as i kept changing the test chip the leadless chip carrier sockets also have long lead lines and may not work at high speeds does anyone out there have experience knowledge of this field i would greatly appreciate help any ideas names of companies manufacturing holders sockets packages would help p s the multi layer fancy gaas packages seem like a bit of overkill

1 | from my rather rusty knowledge of radio most radio receivers use a superhet circuit so that the incoming signal is mixed with a local oscillator giving a fixed intermediate frequency if that is more easily amplified the detector detectors work by picking up if re radiated from your radar detector in britain where one has used to pay for a tv licence there are were tv detector vans prowling the streets looking for people who hadn t paid their licence fee they had a couple of long solenoid antennae on the roof and i believe could triangulate an operating tv from the if i wonder how much of the if is radiated back from the detector antenna and how much from the rest of the module it might be worth putting the detector in a proper rf shielded enclosure
1 | i ve started to look at some devices doing serial data transmission over fairly decent distances in fairly noisy environments and have seen a variety of schemes for protecting the rs232 transceivers and the rest of the circuit from transients on the serial lines i m left wondering what is the best way of doing this how necessary is it stuff deleted what is the wisdom on this out there ta martin from what i know protection is necessary esp if you plan to route the cables into an unknown environment out of your control things like accidental shorts between the signal lines and power cables or even lightning strikes are very likely and i don t think you like to see the sight of your computer going up in smoke even ethernet cards are protected i ve looked at the one in my pc and the connector is protected by a gas discharge tube but if you plan to use the serial cables for internal routings i e in controlled environments it should be reasonably safe not to have them suggestion look in the rs data book they have several rs232 transceivers that have overvoltage protection among them include the lt1080 lt1081 and max250 and max251 the maxims are suppose to be electrically isolated ones but still need opto isolators to work don t ask me why i ve never used them before another alternative is an rs232 surge protector two are listed in the rs catalogue if you need additional info i e stock nos just e mail me

3 | i hate to pour cold water on this but currently seawater extracted uranium even using the new improved fiber absorbers from japan is about 20 times more expensive than uranium on the spot market uranium is very cheap right now around 10 lb right now there are mines closing because they can t compete with places like cigar lake in canada where the ore is so rich they present safety hazards to the mines who work in shielded vehicles plenty of other sources for example uranium from phosphate processing would come on line before uranium reached 200 lb demand and supply balance will collapse is nonsense supply and demand always balance what changes is the price is uranium going to increase in price by a factor of 20 by the end of the century not bloody likely new nuclear reactors are not being built at a sufficient rate uranium from seawater is interesting but it s a long term project or a project that the japanese might justify on grounds of self sufficiency

1 | actually it s a bit more complicated than that i sounds to me your ups takes in ac rectifies it to dc to charge the batteries and then takes the battery dc and chops it to ac again feeding your equipment this approach is the easiest and cleanest way to switchover from the mains to battery once your power kicks out since as you mentioned nothing will know about what happened down the line another way to do the ups scheme is to use the mains until you lose power and then kick in the battery backup with it s inverter to replace the lost power the problem here is the switchover time and you ve got to resync the ac in no time flat unfortunately most everything is built around the assumption that ac is available so the ups guys have to provide and ac output to be usable ya sorta have to make it work with what there already similar story with our telephone system it was first invented back in the 1800 s we re still using the same damn system media as they did back then if i have a phone from back then i can assure you it ll work on today s phone system it costs too much to overhaul everyone to a new system so they make it work with what is out there

1 | it sounds like your tv is one of the ones that also reacts to the video protection poor you the macroscrubber from radio electronics removes the protection so you souldn t have any more problems however if you use the method of copying it from one vcr to another where the second vcr doesn t react to the protection you will end up with a duplicate tape including the protection one thought comes to mind about your problem when playing the tape for viewing are you feeding the signal from the source vcr through an extra device before going to the tv if you feed it through a second vcr first that is your problem as to other devices such as converters i don t know if they would react or not just to be safe you might want to make sure that you have nothing between the vcr and tv

1 | this is a followup post to something i ve written previously several people responded with good information but i don t think i communicated exactly what i am looking for i m working on a custom i o device that will communicate with a host via rs 232 my custom circuitry will use an 80c186eb or ec cpu and require about 64k of ram preferably flash ram in looking around i see that lots of people have engineered uart cpu rom ram subsystems that are ready to be interfaced to your custom i o devices it s been done so much that it would be best if i can avoid reinventing a system it just needs to use an 80c186 or 188 cpu and be able to load a program from the host then transfer control to that program well there s one other thing the rom needs to know how to do it should have routines to send and receive bytes to from the host that utilize the hardware control lines dtr rts dts cts everything i ve seen is in the 200 00 and up range that s too much for this application i need something around 100 00 the cpu has the uart built in so you re only looking at a few chips does anyone know a company that markets a good board in this range or some public domain circuitry i can use thanks in advance for the info
1 | currently i am using the 8051 microcontroller with external eprom in order to drive the dc motor with direction i use the pulse width modultion thru software control assembly language programming however i am afraid that they will be overheads and thus alter the pulse timing my question is is the software pwm control reliable i understand that port 0 is a latch and so i vary the duty cycle by setting it high first and at the desire

3 | suppose the soviets had managed to get their moon rocket working and had made it first they could have beaten us if either their rocket hadn t blown up on the pad thus setting them back and or a saturn v went boom if they had beaten us i speculate that the us would have gone head and done some landings but we also would have been more determined to set up a base both in earth orbit and on the moon whether or not we would be on mars by now would depend upon whether the soviets tried to go setting up a lunar base would have stretched the budgets of both nations and i think that the military value of a lunar base would outweigh the value of going to mars at least in the short run thus we would have concentrated on the moon
2 | as you note the research is mixed so there is no consensus on the role of fatty acids in ulcerative colitis there is a role for short chain fatty acids in patients with colostomies and rectal pouches that are inflammed short is butyrate and shorter there may be a role for treatment of uc with short chain fatty acids and i am looking forward to the upcoming aga meeting in boston to see what people are doing you raise a hypothesis about the studies and restriction of other fatty acids you should contact the authors directly about that or even write a letter to the editor it is a good point by the way the abbreviation epa is not in general use so i do not know what fatty acid you are speaking about and to brian an u of c there is a physician named stephen hanauer there who is a recognized expert in the treatment of ibd you might give him a call he is interested in new combinations of drugs for the treatment of ibd if you call please say hello to him from me i was looking at u of c for a position and perhaps still am and be sure to look into joining the ccfa best of luck
3 | the problem with commercial titan is that mm has made little or no attempt to market it they re basically happy with their government business and don t want to have to learn how to sell commercially a secondary problem is that it is a bit big they d need to go after multi satellite launches a la ariane and that complicates the marketing task quite significantly they also had some problems with launch facilities at just the wrong time to get them started properly if memory serves the pad used for the mars observer launch had just come out of heavy refurbishment work that had prevented launches from it for a year or so there have been a few ct launches mars observer was one of them so was that stranded intelsat and at least one of its brothers that reached orbit properly

1 | you can learn how to build a deyhdrator very easily from the book the hungry hiker s guide to good food by gretchen mchugh the heat source is a 100 watt light bulb basically it s a vertical wooden box with ventilation holes in the top and bottom lots of them you want the air to flow the light bulb goes in the bottom and wire cake racks are spaced every 6 starting about 10 above the bulb or at a slightly higher cost in electricity you can do what i do use your oven note i do this in an electric oven some gas ovens may not have a low enough setting put food to be dried on cookie tins or racks in the oven set oven to 140 degrees the lowest setting on my oven if yours goes down to 120 that s probably even better stick a wooden spoon or something across the front corner of the oven and close the door on the spoon so that it stays open about an inch this allows for airflow leave the stuff in the oven for 6 to 8 hours check it often since this dries it much faster than the dehydrator if you are using cookie sheets instead of racks turn the stuff over halfway through if you want more info e mail me since this isn t really the right sub for this stuff gerald belton ozonehole com slmr 2 1 i still miss my boss but my aim is improving

1 | i would be interested in hearing from anyone who knows of good software for antenna simulation particularly in source form suitable for unix workstations though good pc software would also be of interest i m aware of the numerous mininec mutations and have been using mn for some time now i m primarily interested in hf vhf and low uhf 500 mhz designs mostly wire antennas but for thick wires and mesh surfaces as well as for your basic thin wire assumption is anything interesting happening with nec itself i ve seen a version that was mutilated to run sort of under microsoft fortran but i m not sure how many new and improved versions of the code might be out there somewhere i d also be interested in non nec derivatives the ones i ve seen have been aimed at microwave applications but if there is something out there useful at the lower frequencies i d like to know about it thanks
1 | a method which will directly almost provide you with the information that you require is that which is commonly used for coordinate measurements of human body landmarks eg the selspot system by selspot ab sweden and the watsmart system these use lateral photoeffect detectors lindholm and oberg 1974 woltring and marsolais 1980 to determine the position of a spot of light projected using a camera lens over its surface in escence the detector is a large photodiode with four cathodes one on each of the four sides of the square detector crystal and a single anode the back of the crystal a spot of light will produce currents which are proportional to the position of the spot on the detector s face let s try some ascii graphics in 2 d so the detector has two cathodes to detect linear position 1 cathode 1 xxxxx ________ xxxxx light xxxxx _____ divider __ output xxxxx xxxxx xxxxx ________ 1 2 xxxxx gnd xxxxx xxxxx anode xxxxx cathode 2 2 if the dot of light from the led is the only source of light then the position of the projection is given by this circuit regardless of the level of illumina tion the divider is used to normalize relative to total received power when this circuit is used in the presence of other sources of light then the way of tuning to it is to sample for a few msec the background signal light the led for an equal time and sample that signal separately the difference between the two is the position of the led hamamatsu photonics sells linear and 2 d lateral photoeffect detectors and they also sell the required signal processing electronics the ready made systems by selspot and others are not cheap lindholm l e and k e oberg an optoelectronic instrument for remote on line movement monitoring biotelemetry 1 94 95 1974 woltring h j and e b marsolais opto electronic selspot gait measure ments in two and three dimensional space a preliminary report bull pros thetics research 46 52 1980 most probably this technique can provide you with a much more accurate measurement than you need but i think that its simplicity beats scanning a quadrant detector with a pan tilt system until you reach zero difference david
1 | paul unfortunately there are not too many retail outlets that ll stock just about every chip made the stuff they will stock are the ones that ll sell like standard dram s 80386 s 68000 s etc etc i e i cna t think of any one stop shopping store the closest you can get is to pick up a copy of byte magazine or the circuit cellar popular electronics and the like and flip through them distributors like wyle electronics hamilton avnet pioneer electronics etc etc don t normally deal with end users like ourselves where we only a couple of everything they only deal with people who buy by the hundreds or more each distributor represents and sells a variety of different non competing manufacturers what do i mean by this suppose abc electronics sells intel 80386 s it s a pretty good bet that they won t be selling any of amd s 386 s or vice versa they also can obtain just about any chip you want from a manufacturer they represent who knows you might be lucky to be able to buy from one of them but i d be suprised if you do also bear in mind that the 1 or 2 qty prices they will charge you will be much greater than what a mail order outlet will charge my advice if you re gonna be designing anything try to stick with off the shelf stuff you re going to get stuck if you use too many esoteric parts sooner or later good luck

1 | i live in the san francisco bay area and word has it that something similar is on its way here since we apparently don t have the sensor base you folks have they re installing cameras at strategic points along the freeways initial tests are going to be in the santa clara area i m told with the video being piped into a command center they re building somewhere in the east bay i m not sure if frame grabbers or cheap labor will be used to interpret the data but large multi colored status displays will show the various routes using different colors to represent the various average speeds for each stretch of highway an announcer will sit in front of the status wall and will relay continuous verbal traffic status to those who want to receive it they re apparently also looking into licensing a low am frequency to be dedicated to providing continuous audio from this system in the mean time they ll set up large incandescent display boards along the test stretch to provide commuters with data on traffic conditions up ahead my understanding is that the system is subsidized as a pilot program and information from it will be available free of charge perhaps the la system is similarly free or provided at an obviously subsidized rate read cheap we also have the traffic reports that are broadcast on the sap audio channel of television channels 2 and 36 these are verbal reports qualified with a identification tone to tell in vehicle receivers like the auto talk that the information coming next is applicable to a given area in la they re probably using some other tv channels but the concept is the same try setting your stereo tv or vcr to receive the sap audio channel and go station jumping to find out which one is broadcasting this information i believe this program is also subsidized making the in vehicle receivers cheap to purchase and without having to incur monthly fees to use it since the makers of these in vehicle receivers don t have to pay for the broadcast this may not be completely true they likely have no investment in keeping the system up and running when the cal trans stuff hits the airwaves you may have a nifty little tv audio receiver in your car nothing more when this happens perhaps a word to the wise i think we d all be interested in a summary post if you get more info on how the la system is networked and paid for

2 | and has been rather thoroughly demolished as myth by robert scott root bernstein see his book discovering ring structures for benzene had been proposed before kekule after him and at the same time as him the current models do not resemble kekule s many of the predecessors of kekule s structure resemble the modern model more i don t think extra scientific is a very useful phrase in a discussion of the boundaries of science except as a proposed definiens extra rational is a better phrase in fact there are quite a number of well known cases of extra rational considerations driving science in a useful direction for example pasteur discovered that racemic acid was a mixture of enantiomers the origin of stereochemistry partly because he liked a friend s crank theory of chemical action the friend was wrong but pasteur s discovery stood a prior investigator mitscherlich looking at the same phenomenon had missed a crucial detail presumably because he lacked pasteur s motivation to find something that distinguished racemic acid from tartaric now we say d tartaric acid again pasteur discovered the differential fermentation of enantiomers tartaric acid again not because of some rational conviction but because he was trying to produce yeast that lived on l tartaric acid his notebooks contained fantasies of becoming the newton of mirror image life which he never admitted publically perhaps the best example is the discovery that dna carries genes avery started this work because of one of his students and ardent anglophile and francophobe canadian defended fred griffiths discoveries in mice most of griffiths critics were french which decided the issue for the student avery told him to replicate griffiths work in vitro which the student eventually did whereupon avery was convinced and started the research program which in 15 or so years produced the famous discovery avery macleod and mccarty jem 1944

2 | summary of thread a person has crohns raw vegetables cause problems unspecified steve holland replies patient may have mild obstruction avoid things that would plug her up crohn s has no dietary restriction in general the feeling obout this has changed in the gi community the current feeling is that inflammation is not induced by food there is even evidence that patients deprived of food have mucosal atrophy due to lack of stimulation of intestinal growth factors there is now interest in providing small amounts of nasogastric feeding to patients on iv nutrition but i digress symptoms can be drastically enhanced by food but not inflammation the low residue diet is appropriate for you if you still have obstructions again it is not felt that food causes inflammation these foods are avoided because they may get stuck i d go ahead and have the fudge though spencer makes an especially good point in having an observant and informed patient would that many patients be able to tell what causes them problems the digestive processing idea is changing but if a food causes problems avoid them be sure that the foods are tested a second time to be sure the food is a real cause crohn s commonly causes intermittent symptoms and some patients end up with severly restricted diets that take months to renormalize there was a good article in the ccfa newsletter recently that discussed the issue of dietary restriction of fiber it would be worth reading to anyone with an interest in crohn s and as i always say when dealing with crohn s as does spencer good luck
3 | depends if you assume the existance of a working ssto like dc on billion would be enough to put about a quarter million pounds of stuff on the moon if some of that mass went to send equipment to make lox for the transfer vehicle you could send a lot more either way its a lot more than needed this prize isn t big enough to warrent developing a ssto but it is enough to do it if the vehicle exists allen
3 | also remember that every dollar spent keeping one spacecraft in safe mode probably a spin stabilized sun pointing orientation is a dollar not spent on mission analysis for a newer spacecraft in order to turn the spacecraft back on you either need to insure that the ops guys will be available or you need to retrain a new team having said that there are some spacecraft that do what you have proposed many of the operational satellites goddard flies like the tiros noaa series require more than one satellite in orbit for an operational set extras which get replaced on orbit are powered into a standby mode for use in an emergency in that case however the same ops team is still required to fly the operational birds so the standby maintenance is relatively cheap finally pat s explanation some spacecraft require continuous maintenance to stay under control is also right on the mark i suggested a spin stabilized control mode because it would require little power or maintenance but it still might require some momentum dumping from time to time in the end it is a political decision since the difference is money but there is some technical rationale behind the decision

1 | i recently ftp d al s circuit simulator acs and i m looking for the tutorial which is mentioned in the users manual but not found there i don t have any experience constructing a netlist such as for spice and i need a little help the examples which come with acs aren t explanatory about the translation between schematic and netlist does anyone have the fabled tutorial or any other reference which could help me in constructing a netlist from a schematic diagram i also emailed al himself but received no response yet he s probably busy with his next release tim pillsbury internet tsp ccd harris com uunet uunet ccd harris com timothy pillsbury

1 | we have a setup with with 13 polaroid transducers and rangefinders we would like to fire these three at a time with about 5 ms between firings the three that are being fired do not fire in the same direction to further explain the situation assume we are firing sonars a b c 5 ms apart each other we should normally see an echo on a that corresponds to the distance however sonar a detects the init line of sonar b the detection is actually through the transducer of sonar a we can see a very faint 50khz signal on the transducer exactly at the time the init line of sonar b is activated we feel that there is some ground coupling that is causing this interference we came to this conclusion since we are using a separate power supply for sonars b and c has anyone else had any problems with these particular units and this type of experience your suggestions for remedies will be greatly appreciated

2 | ok just for grins kekule hypothesized a resonant structure for the aromatic benzene ring after waking from a dream in which a snake was swallowing his tail archimedes formalized the principle of buoyancy while meditating in his bath in neither case was there no connection to prior theories concepts etc as you stipulated above what there was was an intuitive leap beyond the current way of thinking to develop ideas which subsequently proved to have predictive power e g they stood the test of experimental verification pardon my kibbutzing
2 | serum actually but plasma numbers are the same whole blood numbers for humans tend to be somewhat lower roughly 5 to 10 percent lower i find the following range for whole blood in fundamentals of clinical chemistry n w teitz editor w b saunders 1987 human glucose whole blood fasting levels 60 95 mg dl indeed they do measure whole blood levels although they are not as accurate as a serum test done in a laboratory one problem is that cells in the sample continue to metabolize glucose after the sample is drawn reducing the apparent level according to teitz however results compare reasonably well with laboratory results although values below 80 mg dl tend to be lower with strip tests whereas values above 240 mg dl can be very erratic as stated above whole blood levels tend to be roughly 5 to 10 percent lower than serum levels sample freshness will affect whole blood levels however i don t believe there is a well defined conversion factor since cell metabolism will affect samples to varying degrees the serum plasma test is much preferred for any except general ball park testing

1 | lots of pretty good stuff about how the huge towers near most nuclear power plants are there to cool the used steam back into near ambient temperature water deleted as a point of info some of the early nuclear power plants in this country used the fission pile as a first stage to get the water hot and then had a second stage fossil fuel step to get the water actually steam very hot i remember seeing this at con edison s indian point 1 power plant which is about 30 miles north of nyc and built more or less 1958 dannyb panix com
2 | so antihistamines can cause weight gain now they tell me is there any way to find out which do which don t my doctor obviously is asleep at the wheel the original poster mentioned fatigue i had that too but it was mostly due to the really bizarre dreams i was having i wasn t getting any rest my doctor said that was a common reaction if astemizole doesn t cross the blood brain barrier how does it cause that side effect any ideas
2 | reply to aldridge netcom com jacquelin aldridge the acquisition of scientific knowledge is completely scientific the application of that knowledge in individual cases may be more art than science certainly we don t have all the answers the question is what is the most reliable means of acquiring further medical knowledge the scientific method has proven itself to be reliable the only reason alternative therapies are shunned by physicians is that their practitioners refuse to submit their theories to rigorous scientific scrutiny insisting that tradition or anecdotal evidence are sufficient these have been shown many times in the past to be very unreliable ways of acquiring reliable knowledge crook s ideas have never been backed up by scientific evidence his unwillingness to do good science makes the rest of us doubt the veracity of his contentions

1 | here in erie pa there is a system in the inner city called rado lite a trade name which allows police and ambulance vehicles to gain right of way by controlling traffic lights through radio signals the receivers look much like what you describe but they include a uhf whip antenna less than a foot tall and a light which flashes on and off to let traffic know that an emergency vehicle has taken control and is approaching local folklore says this system was invented here i don t know if this company has any other installations it has been in operation for at least 30 years going only by my memory

3 | interesting question about galileo galileo s hga is stuck the hga was left closed because galileo had a venus flyby if the hga were pointed att he sun near venus it would cook the foci elements question why couldn t galileo s course manuevers have been designed such that the hga did not ever do a sun point after all it would normally be aimed at earth anyway or would it be that an emergency situation i e spacecraft safing and seek might have caused an hga sun point
1 | i had a catalog with membrane keypads but i dunno what happened to it and it was so long ago that i forget the name of the company anyway you could make your own legend and slip it behind the bezel really nice and reasonably priced can anyone tell me where to get some more of these critters i ve tried several places but none of them seem to have keypads which allow you to use your own legend any suggestion would be appreciated
3 | lot s of these small miners are no longer miners they are people living rent free on federal land under the claim of being a miner the facts are many of these people do not sustaint heir income from mining do not often even live their full time and do fotentimes do a fair bit of environmental damage these minign statutes were created inthe 1830 s 1870 s when the west was uninhabited and were designed to bring people into the frontier times change people change deal you don t have a constitutional right to live off the same industry forever anyone who claims the have a right to their job in particular is spouting nonsense this has been a long term federal welfare program that has outlived it s usefulness

3 | a what about positional uncertainties in s l 1993e i assume we know where and what galileo is doing within a few meters but without the hga don t we have to have some pretty good ideas of where to look before imaging if the hga was working they could slew around in near real time less speed of light delay but when they were imaging toutatis didn t someone have to get lucky on a guess to find the first images also i imagine s l 1993e will be mostly a visual image so how will that affect the other imaging missions with the lga there is a real tight allocation of bandwidth it may be premature to hope for answers but i thought i d throw it on the floor
2 | but it is quite a leap in logic to observe one situation where anecdotal evidence led nowhere and therefore conclude that anecdotal evidence will never lead anywhere i m sure somebody here can provide an example where anecdotal evidence and the interpretation of it was upheld verified by follow on rigorous clinical trials good point there has been a tendency by some on this newsgroup to circle the wagons to the viewpoint that anecdotal medical evidence is worthless maybe to counter the claims of those who are presenting anecdotal evidence to support controversial subjects such as the yeast hypothesis but evidence is evidence it requires a jury or a process to sort it out and determine the truth from the junk medicine must continue to strive to better understand the workings of the body mind for the purpose of alleviating illness anecdotal evidence is just one piece of the puzzle it is not worthless rather it can help focus limited resources in the right direction jon noring charter member infj club
3 | two developments have brought these type of activities back to the forefront in 1993 first in february the russians deployed a 20 m reflector from a progress vehicle after it had departed from the mir space station while this banner reflector was blank npo energia was very active in reporting that future banner reflectors will be available to advertisers who could use a space based video of their logo or ad printed on the banner in a tv commercial as filmed from the mir the second development has been that space marketing inc the same company responsible for merchandising space on the conestoga booster and comet spacecraft is now pushing the environmental billboard as laid out by smi chief engineer dr ron humble of the university of colorado space laboratory and preston carter of the lawrence livermore national laboratory the environmental billboard is a large inflatable outer support structure of up to 804x1609 meters advertising is carried by a mylar reflective area deployed by the inflatable frame to help sell the concept the spacecraft responsible for maintaining the billboard on orbit will carry ozone reading sensors to continuously monitor the condition of the earth s delicate protective ozone layer according to mike lawson head of smi furthermore the inflatable billboard has reached its minimum exposure of 30 days it will be released to re enter the earth s atmosphere according to imi as the biodegradable material burns it will release ozone building components that will literally replenish the ozone layer the remaining spacecraft will monitor the atmosphere for another year before it too re enters and burns up and adds to the ozone supply this would not be a cheap advertisement costing at least several millions of dollars exact costs were not available but smi estimates that market exposure would be 3 5x that of the people who watched the superbowl where a 30 second advertising unit cost 600 000 since smi is located in atlanta georgia it is being promoted as being available in time for the opening of the 1996 summer olympics in atlanta but back to brian s questions see above as for serious if they can get 15 20 m or so my estimate of 5 10 for development costs and a flight unit plus 10 15 m for a launch then it s probably real they are claiming to tailor the orbit to overfly specific locations at specific times for optimum advertising impact so they probably can t piggy back upon someone else s planned launch and will have to buy a dedicated launch that s a 10 15 m cost they need to raise right there and there will probably be some legal challenges to this as well note there is one potential legal challenge to smi on the use of launch vehicle advertising already while i don t think the legal challenges would win out and yes i am an amateur astronomer and no i don t really like the idea of this additional light pollution but i know of no prohibition of it the legal challenges and court fights would probably remove any positive aspects of the advertising i can imagine several ways to make the advertisers look like louts for doing this which would change positive market exposure to negative market exposure and negate the space advertising advantage would you spend 15 m to look like an idiot and light pollution might not be too bad if it s in a low enough orbit and it relies upon reflected light only it would only be visible for a short time just after local dusk and before dawn for maximum market exposure you want to have it visible just after dusk minimizing impact on astronomy since that s the time of worse seeing due to day night thermal turbulence it might still be a problem but perhaps there are ways to mitigate this as for having real funding none that i can identify there were about 60 expressions of interest made on the conestoga advertising opportunity but that included curious folks and was for only a 500 000 commitment i haven t heard of any serious funding for this but i m sure they are shopping the venture around looking for some money in order to flesh out the concept some more but i am confident there are no firm or paying customers at this time and if anybody wants to cross post this to sci astro please be my guest i don t have posting privileges to that area or at least i don t think i do wales larrison space technology investor
2 | i don t think that s a problem my face is quite oily too i had a moderate acne problem for many years i then found that if i vigorously scrub my face with a nail brush and soap irish spring twice a day the acne was not a problem i can still leave a pretty health nose print on a mirror after 45 min don t ask but acne is not a real problem anymore
2 | i know that there is msg sensitivity when i eat foods with msg i get very thirsty and my hands swell and get a terrible itchy rash i first experienced this problem when i worked close to chinatown and ate chinese food almost everyday for lunch now i can t tolerate msg at all i can notice immediately when i have eaten any i try to avoid msg completely interesting fact though is that all three of my children started experiencing the exact same rash on their hands i couldn t understand why because i don t msg in cooking and we ask for no msg when we do eat chinese i still love it after some investigation i knew that oodles of noodles where one of their favorite foods one of the main ingredients in the flavor packets is msg now i look at all labels you would be surprised at places you find msg
2 | reply to ron roth rose com ron roth while you re right that the s vertebrae are attached to each other the sacrum to my knowledge can be adjusted either directly or by applying pressure on the pubic bone ron you re an endless source of misinformation there are no sacral vertebrae there is a bone called the sacrum at the end of the spine it is a single solid bone except in a few patients who have a lumbarized s1 as a normal variant how do you adjust a solid bone break it no don t tell me i don t want to know oh come now surely you know he only meant to measure the flow of electromagnetic energy about the sacrum and then adjust these flows with a crystal of chromium applied to the right great toe don t you know anything
1 | this is vague so i am posting it in case anyone else knows more i recall reading of a phonograph which used mechanical amplification compressed air was squirted out of a valve which was controlled by the pickup the result was noisy and distinctly lo fi but much louder than a conventional phonograph it tended to wear the disks out pretty quickly though paul
1 | ok i ve asked this before and with a new thread on these lines i ask this again 1 if a large hole current is run thru a resistor will there be i 2 r cooling instead of heating 2 can anyone design an amplifier that preferentially amplifies hole currents over normal electron currents 3 what semiconductor materials have the highest ratio of hole mobility to electron mobility please quote actual test samples rather than estimates based on theory also don t be limited to semiconductors consider also insulators resistors dielectrics piezo electrics conductors magnets metal ceramic magnetostrictives etc notes to summarize this thread has so far stated that the only area where holes are not detectable is the vacuum that is hole particles only exist in the presence of matter previous threads have stated that holes only exist in certain semi conductors the question that naturally arises is if the hole currents inside a semi conductor vanish at the point where the semiconductor is joined to a conductor say copper i don t want a theoretical discussion here about whether holes could exist inside metal conductors rather i ask for an experimental discussion on how to amplify and detect such currents if they exist also note that i have cross posted this to sci electronics since this is now becoming an electronic discussion thanx eric et a force of nature
2 | dn from nyeda cnsvax uwec edu david nye dn a neurology dn consultation is cheaper than a scan and also better because a neurologist can make a differential diagnosis between migraine tension type headache cluster benign intracranial hypertension chronic paroxysmal hemicrania and other headache syndromes that all appear normal on a scan a neurologist can also recommend a course of treatment that is appropriate to the diagnosis dn also since many people are convinced they have brain tumors or other dn serious pathology it may be cheaper to just get a ct scan then have dn them come into the er every few weeks dn and easier than taking the time to reassure the patient right dn personally i don t think this can ever be justified sigh it may never be justifiable but i sometimes do it even after i try to show thoroughness with a detailed history neurologic examination and discussion with the patient about my diagnosis salted with lots of reassurance patients still ask why can t you order a scan so we can be absolutely sure aunt millie often gets into the conversation as in they ignored aunt millie s headaches for years and then she died of a brain tumor aneurysm or whatever if you can get away without ever ordering imaging for a patient with an obviously benign headache syndrome i d like to hear what your magic is every once in a while i am able to bypass imaging by getting an eeg mind you i don t think eeg is terribly sensitive for brain tumor but the patient feels like something is being done as if the hours i spent talking with and examining the patient were nothing the eeg has no ionizing radiation it s much cheaper than ct or mri and the eeg brings in some money to my department

1 | i am looking at buying a low cost 500 scope for general purpose use any recommendations is this info in a faq somewhere any pointers appreciated thanks gerard
1 | actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling water reactor nuclear plants there s a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses 1900 vintage steam technology so it s more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible hence big cooling towers when the utility gave up on that cinnci oh plant zimmer and announced they were going to convert it to a coal fired scheme the turbines were already in place and they were the low temp type so the plan was install a second set of high temp turbines and feed the low temp ones with the output of the new ones never saw anything more on this did they ever really build it
1 | here s a question for all you electrical engineers out there i bought an infrared detector module at radio shack for 3 95 it is a little gizmo that senses infrared remotes and produces an output signal then i hooked the output through a transistor to an infrared led the circuit works like a minature remote control extender in my car all remote commands are relayed to the cd player hidden in the glove compartment it works fine with my denon cd player but when i tried to build the same circuit for a friend s vcr it didn t work the circuit appears to work for other remotes you can see infrared with a sony ccd camcorder but coincidentally it only seems to work for my cd player any advice would be appreciated brian
3 | actually there are people who will tell you that it would be enough to do ssto development if done privately as a cut rate operation of course they may be over optimistic you can also assume that a working ssto would have other applications that would help pay for its development costs i d be inclined to make the prize somewhat larger but 1g might be enough
1 | can i suggest the university of western australia in perth the weathers great the people are great and our electronic engineering department is great i am a first year student here so i don t know much about what projects but i do know they have a good reputation in the fields of dsp and communications ever heard of qpsx the people who own are ex uwa so that gives an indication of what the department is like for more information email yianni swanee ee uwa edu au with the above request and he should be able to tell some more info or write department of electrical and electronic engineering university of western australia stirling highway crawley 6009 western australia australia yours mark mtearle tartarus uwa edu au

2 | a friend of mine has been diagnosed with psoriatic arthritis as a result of trauma sustained in a car accident several years ago the psoriasis is under control but the arthritis part of the illness is not ansaid non steroidal anti inflammatory worked pretty well for three years but isn t helping much now my friend is now taking meclomen another nsaid but this isn t helping control the pain at all in the past two months my friend has also started taking azulfadine along with the nsaid medicines but the effects of the combined drugs aren t supposed to be realized for several months as a result of the pain my friend is having problems sleeping staying in one position too long is an ordeal another major contributor to pain is that tendonitis has now developed left thumb and hand with numbness at the base of the palm bottom of feet shoulders and outer thighs the tendonitis is quite painful yet my friend s doctor has not recommended any form of treatment to relieve it the latest twist is that the doctor has dropped the anti inflammatories and is now recommending prednisone the hope is that the prednisone will relieve some of the pain from the tendonitis my friend is a 41 year old male who feels like he s 80 his words not mine if anyone is aware of any new treatments for psoriatic arthritis alternative courses of action support groups or literature on it i would be extremely grateful if you could e mail to me if anyone is interested i ll post a summary to this newsgroup

3 | i don t have to try reading a bit pat i work as a government contractor and know what the rules are like yes they sign some damned few which is why everyone is always having to go to washington to see about next week s funding multi year contracts they also aren t willing to include sufficient cancellation penalties when they do decide to cut the multi year contract and not pay on it which can happen arbitrarily at any time no matter what previous plans were to make the risk acceptable of something like putting up a private space station with the government as the expected prime occupant i d like a source for that statement about the reason they aren t cutting defense spending as much as they would like i just don t buy it the other thing i find a bit funny about your posting pat is that several other people answered the question pretty much the same way i did mine is the one you comment and incorrectly i think on i think that says a lot you and tommy should move in together insisting on perfect safety is for people who don t have the balls to live in the real world mary shafer nasa ames dryden

1 | careful now folks also consider the 90vac 20hz that is forced on ring and tip when the phone s supposed to ring even with a simple zener and led setup you might end up with some carbon real quick whatever scheme you use make sure you ve got at least 200v rated components on the frontend also remember that if i m not mistaken the phone line is a 600ohm equivalent circuit any current you draw from the 48v or so gets dropped across that 600ohms that s fine until you re down to roughly 12v when ma bell considers it to be off hook but dropping it that far down is probably a big no no the easiest implementation to accomplish the above tip rectifier resistor diode v zener resistor v led ring this is only a suggestion go ahead and blow holes in it but you get the idea choose a high efficiency led so you don t need much current to get it to light up choose values for the other components as required

1 | could convenient then and called global earth get meters on thought it means global positioning system there are two precision levels one for army applications killing has to be very accurate today and one for civil ones the civil precision is about 20 to 30m correct me if i m wrong though it may be insufficiant for mapping buildings but there is a way with an additional reference point e g one fixed gps system in a house to get the same high precision as the military version but it gets pretty complicated then if you use a microwave system actually this means some type of radar you need quite a lot of number crunching to get accurate vectorized data out of your original signals so the gps system seems to be the better and running idea for your application there have been discussions in this newsgroup don t know of an address anymore cheers robert hb9nby

3 | the situation in this regard has changed considerably in recent years see the discussion of high power rocketry in the rec models rockets frequently asked questions list this is not hardware you can walk in off the street and buy you need proper certification that can be had mostly through tripoli the high power analog of the nar although the nar is cautiously moving to extend the upper boundaries of what it considers proper too you need special faa authorization but provided you aren t doing it under one of the lax runway approaches or something stupid like that it s not especially hard to arrange as with model rocketry this sort of hardware is reasonably safe if handled properly proper handling takes more care and you need a lot more empty air to fly in but it s basically just model rocketry scaled up as with model rocketry the high power people use factory built engines which eliminates the major safety hazard of do it yourself rocketry
1 | hi all i m an assistant manager at a local art theater here in columbus i d like to expand our show automation a bit namely add the capability to use cue tapes to bring the houselights up our current automation consoles date from the early 60 s and don t provide this function we already have the combo failsafe contact rollers to read the cuetapes and our dimmer system will raise the houselights when its fade up control circuit 120 vac is momentarily closed for at least 0 5 second i ve tried wiring the dimmer control to a 12v relay activated when the cue tape completes the circuit low tech and simple but there s one problem in order to get the 1 2 second pulse there needs to be a sh load of cuetape on the film 35mm runs at 90 feet per minute so to get a 1 2 second pulse there needs to be at least 9 inches of solid cuetape ideally i would like to use a single cross cue to accomplish this function a single strip of cuetape perpendicular to the length of the film this would give a pulse of approximately 1 100 of a second what i need is a circuit to detect the short cue and activate the relay for around 1 2 second the ability to adjust how long the relay is activated would be nice i figure this would require an rc circuit of some sort i m sure some of you already have the solution figured out in your heads any suggestions and schematics would be appreciated thanks mark fontana

2 | as nobody in the food industry has even bothered to address my previous question why do you need to put msg in almost every food i must assume that my wife s answer is closer to the truth than i hoped it was she believes that msg is added to food to cause people to eat more of it and not quit when they shoud be sated to put it a different way she believes that for some people msg causes them to act toward food like an addict eat all the chips chow down on several packages of noodle soup you get the idea if she is right then the moral and ethical standards of the food chemical and regulatory groups need to be addressed can msg be considered a conditioning substance not addictive but sort of habit forming this brings up a side question of mine i have noticed that cats my children s and my parent s seem to fixate on a particular brand of pet food the cat will eat any product within one brand and not any other brand i have wondered if this is not a case of preference but some sort of chemical training or addiction my questions for the net are does the fda regulate the contents of pet food is it allowed for pet food to contain addictive or conditioning substances is msg put in pet food i speak for myself and not motorola

2 | i can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it s environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics these are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief like elaine in sci med nutrition and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling quack could it just be professional jealousy i couldn t help elaine or jon but somebody else did could they know more than me no way they must be a quack i ve been teaching a human nutrition course for medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are those that were raised on farms and saw first hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school switched to the vegan diet typically this is about 1 3 of my class of 90 students those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class that s okay because i know that some of what i m teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the u s it s really too bad that most u s medical schools don t cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a non disease by so many in the medical profession in animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with good bacteria after antibiotics are stopped medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier steve got real upset with elaine s doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling elaine s doctor a quack here is a brief primer on yeast yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts the most common organism responsible for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a yeast like fungus an infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis candidiasis is a very rare occurance because like an e coli infection it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level diabetes or an oral course of antibiotics has been used in diabetics their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose candida unlike bacteria is very limited in it s food fuel selection without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in diabetics skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers the bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain when the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to treat it if it s internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about 30 of all american s die with less vitamin a than they were born with u s autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer says but even in patients being given the anti fungals the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus gi tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed lack of a good bacterial flora in the body and or poor mucus membrane barrier lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth from it s name it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment in the vagina l acidophilius is the predominate bacteria unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics in the gi system the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh e mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes it s nice to know that i don t have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me 90 better steve dyer calls him a quack candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment the vagina becomes alkaline during a woman s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract i would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this my wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti fungal creams this was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem recurring vaginal yeast infections this m d did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and l acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile after three treatments sex returned to our marraige i have often wondered what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndrome the nonpathogenic bacteria l acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b6 and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose it s not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut if steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor s use of vitamin a and anti fungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart s content if you saved your venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone i wouldn t have a problem with your behavior martin banschbach ph d professor of biochemistry and chairman department of biochemistry and

space applications by paul m koloc eight ans topical meeting on technology of fusion energy special issue fusion technology march 1989 aneutronic energy fusion with little or negligible neutron flux requires plasma pressures and stable confinement times larger than can be delivered by current approaches if plasma pressures appropriate to burn times on the order of milliseconds could be achieved in aneutronic fuels then high power densities and very compact realtively clean burning engines for space and other special applications would be at hand the plasmaktm innovation will make this possible its unique pressure efficient structure exceptional stability fluid mechanically compressible mantle and direct inductive mhd electric power conversion advantages are described peak burn densities of tens of megawats per cc give it compactness even in the multi gigawatt electric output size engineering advantages indicate a rapid development schedule at very modest cost i strongly recommend that people take this guy seriously bob hirsch the primary proponent of the tokamak has recently declared koloc s plasmaktm precursor the spheromak to be one of 3 promising fusion technologies that should be pursued rather than tokamak aside from the preceeding appeal to authority the plasmaktm looks like it finally models ball lightning with solid mhd physics jim bowery ion

1 | well one reason for getting conflicting answers is that it depends on what you want the ground plane to do a continuous conductor is a good electrostatic shield do you have signals on your board that need shielding rom other things this shielding won t do much good for magnetic fields unless you make it continuous around the circuit to be shielded like a faraday cage
2 | getting back to the original question in this thread i experienced breathing difficulties a few years ago similar to those described in my case it turned out that i was developing type i diabetes although i never sought direct confirmation of this from my doctor i think that the breathing problem was associated with the presence of ketones due to the diabetes i think that ketosis can occur in lesser degree if one is restricting their food intake drastically i don t know if this relevant in this case but you might ask your daughter if she has been eating properly

1 | i believe that the a d converters found on a joystick port are really timers that tick off how long it takes an r c circuit the r being your paddle to charge up to something like 1 2 vcc for games this works pretty well but you certainly wouldn t want to try to take lab measurements off something as non linear as that hmm i suppose you could linearize it in software but the real problem is that the precision of your measurement is no longer constant higher voltages would be more precise on the other hand i could be wrong and perhaps the game card designers splurged for the extra 50 to make a cheap constant current source out of an op amp but i wouldn t expect that

2 | i suspect you mean laparoscopic instead of orthoscopic by far the still best method to diagnose a hernia is old fashioned physical examination if you have an obvious hernia sac coming down into your scrotum or a bulge in your groin that is brought about by increasing intra abdominal pressure sometimes is not that obvious the hernia is small and you can only detect it by putting your finger into the inguinal canal whether you have a recurrent hernia or this is related to the previous operation i can t tell you the person that examined you is in the best position to make that determination are there non invasive ways of diagnosing a hernia every now and then folks write about ct scans and ultrasounds for this but these are far too expensive and unlikely to be better than a trained examining finger

1 | i would like to be able to amplify a voltage signal which is output from a thermocouple preferably by a factor of 100 or 1000 so that the resulting voltage can be fed more easily into a personal computer based adc data acquisition card might anyone be able to point me to references to such circuits i have seen simple amplifier circuits before but i am not sure how well they work in practice in this case i d like something which will amplify sufficiently nicely to be used for thermocouples say a few degrees accuracy or better
1 | jason haines said what to do with old 256k to all on 04 15 93 04 38 jh i was wondering if people had any good uses for old jh 256k simms i have a bunch of them for the apple mac jh and i know lots of other people do to i have tried to jh sell them but have gotten no interest how about collecting them all together ie everyones and selling them as a lot the other thing is to give to a recycler jh so if you have an inovative use or want to buy jh some simms 8 i would be very interested in hearing jh about it if they are free and you can send them real cheap i would be intrested in them hehehe are these 2 chip or 8 chip devices what speed jh i have seen ram disc storage devices but they have been jh very pricey plus i am still a little worried about having data jh stored on ram why do you use a ram disk stephen cyberman toz buffalo ny us mangled on fri 04 16 1993 at 19 58 29

2 | i recall reading in the recently revised edition of the yeast connection that there is indeed work by researchers to do this of course they are working on the theory that candida overbloom with penetration into mucus membrane tissue with associated mild inflammatory response can and does occur in a large number of people if you reject this yeast hypothesis then i d guess you d view this research as one more wasteful and quixotic endeavor stay tuned jon noring charter member infj club

1 | this was the pathe you are thinking of although there were other imitators it didn t wear the disks any more than conventional acoustic designs but it did have a high noise level due to the continual hiss of escaping air there are a lot of them still operating and they are pretty ingenious

2 | i have become involved in a project to further develop and improve the performance of spect single photon emission computerized tomography imaging we will eventually have to peddle this stuff somewhere and so as i move this thing along i would like to know what is the current resolution of spect imaging what kinds of jobs is spect used for specifically what kind of specific jobs could i hope that spect could be used for if its resolution improved say to close to that of pet positron emission tomography and how much does a spect machine cost how much does a single spect image cost if anyone knows the answer to any or all of these questions or where i could find that answer i would be very grateful indeed thanks in advance for any replies

3 | in fact you can all direct your ire at the proper target by ingoring nasa altogether the rocket is a commercial launch vechicle a conestoga flying a comet payload nasa is simply the primary customer i believe sdio has a small payload as well the advertising space was sold by the owners of the rocket who can do whatever they darn well please with it in addition these anonymous observers had no reason to be startled the deal made space news at least twice i think its only fair to find that out before everyone starts having a hissy fit the fact that they bothered to use the conditional tense suggests that it has not yet been approved

2 | sometimes i have a problem with doctor s prescribing medicine like this i of course don t know the exact situation and anti depressants may work but it isn t helping the ringing at all is it mine started about three years back turns out i have tinnitus bilateral translation ringing in both ears basically if this is what it is she ll probably get used to it it would keep me up and drive me nuts too but nowadays i have to plug both my ears with my fingers to check to see if they are ringing usually they are but you get so used to it it just gets tuned out yes this is what i ve read about it not just from my own personal experience millions have it according to my physician you just learn to cope with it like i mentioned earlier by ignoring it it eventually becomes unconscious the doc also said it could be caused by diet ie too much caffeine and stress but i haven t changed my lifestyle much and it just comes and goes it is always there somewhat but now i rarely notice it when it really kicks in also it doesn t necessarily mean there is any hearing loss either caused by it or causing it i had an ent ear nose throat exam and passed in fact my hearing is quite good considering i don t take as good of care of my hearing as i should her reaction is normal if it is tinnitus chances are good she ll begin to not even notice it this info is taken mostly from a few experts my own experience and some readings sorry it was a few years back and don t have any specifics handy
2 | from article 1993apr22 233001 13436 vax oxford ac uk by krishnas vax oxford ac uk the areas that are least likely to hurt are where you have a little fat i inject on my legs and gut and prefer the gut i can stick it in at a 90 degree angle and barely feel it i m not fat just have a little gut my legs however are muscular and i have to pinch to get anything and then i inject at about a 45 degree angle and it still hurts the rate of absorbtion differs for subcutaneous and muscular injections however so if it s a daily thing it would be best not to switch places every day to keep consistencey although some suggest switch legs or sides of the stomach for each shot to prevent irritation when you clean the spot off with an alcohol prep wait for it to dry somewhat or you may get the alcohol in the puncture and of course that doesn t feel good a way to prevent irratation is to mark the spot that you injected a good way to do this is use a little round bandage and put it over the spot this helps prevent you from injecting in the same spot and spacing the sites out accuartely about 1 1 2 apart this is from experience so i hope it ll help you i have diabetes and have to take an injection every morning later david
